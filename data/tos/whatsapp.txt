PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS.
IF YOU ARE A WHATSAPP USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, YOU AND WE AGREE TO SUBMIT ALL DISPUTES TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
THIS MEANS YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.
THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO BRING A CLAIM, INCLUDING THE TIME TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION.
FINALLY, YOU MAY BRING A CLAIM ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF, AND NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY OFFICIAL OR OTHER PERSON, OR CLASS OF PEOPLE.
YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN, OR HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS, A CLASS ACTION, A CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
"Excluded Dispute" means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents).
For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.

Federal Arbitration Act. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this "Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users" section, including any question whether a Dispute between WhatsApp and you is subject to arbitration.

Agreement To Arbitrate For WhatsApp Users Located In The United States Or Canada. For WhatsApp users who live in the United States or Canada, WhatsApp and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes.
WhatsApp and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration.
WhatsApp and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the "AAA Rules").
The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules.
The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org.
The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated.
The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.

Opt-Out Procedure. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms.
and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision.
You must use this address to opt out:
WhatsApp Inc.

United States of America
You must include: (i) your name and residence address.
(ii) the mobile phone number associated with your account.
and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of our Terms' agreement to arbitrate.

Small Claims Court. As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local "small claims" court's rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local "small claims" court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.

Time Limit To Bring Claim. We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must bring claims (including commencing an arbitration proceeding) within one year after the Dispute first arose.
otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred.
This means that if we or you do not bring a claim (including commencing an arbitration) within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the claim will be dismissed because it was started too late.

No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, Or Representative Actions For Users Located In The United States Or Canada. We and you each agree that if you are a WhatsApp user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people.
We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.

Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption "Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users" will be null and void as to that Dispute.

Place To File Permitted Court Actions. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the applicable provision in the "Dispute Resolution" section set forth above.

Special arbitration provision for United States or Canada users

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE ONLY TO OUR UNITED STATES AND CANADA USERS.
IF YOU ARE A WHATSAPP USER LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES OR CANADA, IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF ALL DISPUTES, EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT INVOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DISPUTES AND EXCEPT THOSE THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
THIS MEANS YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE SUCH DISPUTES RESOLVED IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY.
THIS SECTION ALSO LIMITS THE TIME YOU HAVE TO START AN ARBITRATION OR, IF PERMISSIBLE, A COURT ACTION.
FINALLY, THIS SECTION WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTE HEARD AND RESOLVED AS A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

“Excluded Dispute” means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos, trade dress, trade secrets, and patents).
For clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded Disputes.

Federal Arbitration Act. The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” section, including any question whether a Dispute between WhatsApp and you is subject to arbitration.

Agreement to Arbitrate for WhatsApp Users Located in the United States or Canada. For WhatsApp users located in the United States or Canada, WhatsApp and you each agree to waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded Disputes.
WhatsApp and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes), including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration.
WhatsApp and you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is started, including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”).
The arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules.
The AAA Rules, information regarding initiating a Dispute, and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org.
The arbitrator will decide whether a Dispute can be arbitrated.
The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs for such arbitration shall be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.
Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, we will reimburse you for all the AAA administrative fees in Disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.

Opt-Out Procedure. You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither we nor you can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify us in writing postmarked within 30 days of the later of: (i) the date that you first accepted our Terms.
and (ii) the date you became subject to this arbitration provision.
You must use this address to opt-out:
WhatsApp Inc.

Arbitration Opt-Out 
1601 Willow Road 
Menlo Park, California 94025 
United States of America
You must include: (1) your name and residence address.
(2) the mobile phone number associated with your account.
and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of our Terms’ agreement to arbitrate.

Small Claims Court. As an alternative to arbitration, if permitted by your local “small claims” court’s rules, you may bring your Dispute in your local “small claims” court, as long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.

Time Limit to Start Arbitration. We and you agree that for any Dispute (except for the Excluded Disputes) we and you must commence an arbitration proceeding within one year after the Dispute first arose.
otherwise, such Dispute is permanently barred.
This means that if we or you do not commence an arbitration within one year after the Dispute first arose, then the arbitration will be dismissed because it was started too late.

No Class Actions, Class Arbitrations, or Representative Actions for Users Located in the United States or Canada. We and you each agree that if you are a WhatsApp user located in the United States or Canada, each of we and you may bring Disputes against the other only on its or your own behalf, and not on behalf of any other person or entity, or any class of people.
We and you each agree not to participate in a class action, a class-wide arbitration, Disputes brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated Disputes involving any other person or entity in connection with any Dispute.

Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other Disputes brought on behalf of third parties is found to be unenforceable for a Dispute, then all of the provisions above under the caption “Special Arbitration Provision for United States or Canada Users” will be null and void as to that Dispute.

Place to File Permitted Court Actions. If you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, if your Dispute is an Excluded Dispute, or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to be subject to the “Forum and Venue” provisions in the “Dispute Resolution” section set forth above.

WhatsApp Privacy Policy
WhatsApp Intellectual Property Policy
WhatsApp Brand GuidelinesWhatsApp Privacy PolicyLast modified: August 25, 2016 (archived versions) Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA.
Since we started WhatsApp, we’ve aspired to build our Services with a set of strong privacy principles in mind.
WhatsApp provides messaging, Internet calling, and other services to users around the world.
Our Privacy Policy helps explain our information (including message) practices.
For example, we talk about what information we collect and how this affects you.
We also explain the steps we take to protect your privacy – like building WhatsApp so delivered messages aren’t stored and giving you control over who you communicate with on our Services.
When we say “WhatsApp,” “our,” “we,” or “us,” we’re talking about WhatsApp Inc.
This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all of our apps, services, features, software, and website (together, “Services”) unless specified otherwise.

If a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver it.
If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.
To improve performance and deliver media messages more efficiently, such as when many people are sharing a popular photo or video, we may retain that content on our servers for a longer period of time.
We also offer end-to-end encryption for our Services, which is on by default, when you and the people with whom you message use a version of our app released after April 2, 2016.
End-to-end encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect against us and third parties from reading them.

WhatsApp PaymentsWhatsApp Payments Terms of ServiceLast modified: July 9, 2018 (archived versions) WhatsApp Inc.
(“WhatsApp,” “our,” “we,” or “us”) provides messaging, Internet calling, and other services to users around the world, including the ability to send and receive payments through designated payment service providers (“PSPs”) in India (“Payments”) via Unified Payments Interface (“UPI”) developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (“NPCI”).
Payments is a “Service” as defined in the WhatsApp Terms of Service (“Terms”), and the following WhatsApp Payments Terms of Service (“Payments Terms”) supplement the Terms and apply to your use of Payments.
You agree to the Payments Terms when you use Payments.

About our payment service

Our Role.
Payments is a service we provide through, and in coordination with, designated PSPs.
We provide a convenient platform that enables you to submit transaction instructions to PSPs for processing via UPI.
We are not a licensed financial institution, do not receive, transfer, or store any funds in connection with Payments, and are not responsible for UPI service interruptions or acts or omissions of PSPs or banks including the payment, settlement, and clearance of funds.
You have a separate relationship with your bank regarding your bank account, and WhatsApp has no affiliation with your bank in this respect.

PSP’s Role.
When you send or receive funds through Payments, a designated PSP receives the instructions and processes the transaction via UPI.
By using Payments, you will also need to agree to the PSP’s terms and privacy policy, which will be presented to you when you first use Payments.
The PSP’s terms and privacy policy are also available here.
These Payments Terms govern the relationship between WhatsApp and you regarding Payments, and the PSP’s terms govern the relationship between the PSP and you.

Eligibility.
To use Payments, you must use a phone number with the country code for India and have a bank account with a bank that supports UPI.
The phone number you use for our Services must be the same phone number linked to your bank account used for Payments.


Registration and UPI PIN setup.
You must be an owner of the bank account you use to send and receive funds through Payments.
After you provide information to confirm your mobile banking account, WhatsApp facilitates creation of a UPI ID (virtual payment address) that is associated with your WhatsApp account.
Since your transaction instructions are processed via UPI, you must have a UPI PIN to send payments.
We will ask you to create a UPI PIN to send payments if you do not already have one for your bank account.


Age.
You must be at least 18 years old to use Payments.


Credits.
We may credit your bank account for purposes including rewards and special offers.
Our affiliate WhatsApp Application Services Private Limited provides such credits on our behalf.

Fees and Taxes.
You must pay any applicable fees arising out of your use of Payments, including any overdraft, transaction, or other fees charged by your bank, PSPs, or WhatsApp.
You must comply with applicable tax laws in connection with your use of Payments, including reporting and payment of any taxes related to transactions made through Payments and any income received from such transactions.
WhatsApp is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or other tax arising from any transaction you complete using Payments.

Privacy policy and user data
WhatsApp cares about your privacy.

If you use Payments, you agree to our data practices, including the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your information as described in our Privacy Policy and our Payments Privacy Policy.
Use of payments

Payment Amount.
You are responsible for the total payment amount.
You must ensure that you have sufficient funds in your bank account before executing any transaction through Payments.
Your payment will not be sent if the PSP or your bank determines that your bank account lacks sufficient funds to cover the entire transaction amount.

Acceptable Use of Payments.
You must access and use Payments only for legal, authorized, and acceptable purposes, according to our Terms and posted policies including merchant policies as may be published from time to time.
A PSP or WhatsApp may impose limits on your ability to send or receive payments, including transaction limits.
A PSP or WhatsApp may also cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates the Terms, these Payments Terms, posted policies, or the PSP’s terms.


Purchase Transactions.
If you use Payments to pay for goods or services, you agree to make legitimate purchases and to be bound by any terms of the sale.
We have no responsibility for any goods or services purchased using Payments, including for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, chargebacks or disputes associated with transactions.
WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PURCHASED USING PAYMENTS.

Payments Transactions Are Final.
Once you submit a payment, it is final.
WhatsApp does not provide refunds or facilitate chargebacks.
WhatsApp is not liable for unauthorized transactions.
We assume no responsibility for the underlying transaction of funds, or the actions or identity of any transfer recipient or sender.

Business Use of Payments.
If you are a business and use our Services, you must comply with all applicable laws associated with your use of our Services, including Payments.
You must clearly disclose any applicable terms and fees to your customers and promptly fulfill any goods or services you sell using Payments in accordance with any sale terms and applicable laws.

Your continued use of Payments confirms your acceptance of our Payments Terms, as amended.
