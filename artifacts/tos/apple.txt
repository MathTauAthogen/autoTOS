 Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions 

These terms and conditions create a contract between you and Apple (the “Agreement”).
Please read the Agreement carefully.
To confirm your understanding and acceptance of the Agreement, click “Agree.”
A.
INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES
This Agreement governs your use of Apple’s services (“Services”), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to media, apps (“Apps”), and other in-app services (“Content”).
Our Services are: iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, Apple Music, and Apple News.
Our Services are available for your use in your country of residence (“Home Country”).
To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply).
Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.

B.
USING OUR SERVICES
PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS 
You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services.
However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International and you acquire an App or a book, Apple Distribution International is the merchant of record.
this means that you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International, and it is licensed by the App Provider (as defined below) or book publisher.
When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions.
If you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint.
Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204030.
Apple will charge your payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes.
If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability).
In accordance with local law, Apple may update information regarding your payment method if provided such information by your financial institution.
For details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5582.
All Transactions are final.
Content prices may change at any time.
If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.
From time to time, Apple may refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.
Terms related to gift cards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/.

APPLE ID 
Using our Services and accessing your Content requires an Apple ID.
An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem.
Your Apple ID is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security.
Apple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your Apple ID.
Please contact Apple if you suspect that your Apple ID has been compromised.

You must be age 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the registration process) to create an Apple ID and use our Services.
Apple IDs for persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution.

All Services:
- You may use the Services and Content only for personal, noncommercial purposes (except as set forth in the App Store Content section below).

You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period.
If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information.
This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period.
Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method.
If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription before the free trial ends.

Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features.

Purchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows you to share eligible Content with up to six members of a Family.
The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members.
The Organizer's payment method is used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first).
Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s payment method is used.
The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions, and (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized.
Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contract, and assume all risk related to sharing access to the payment method with Family members.
A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and the Organizer.

Ask to Buy: Ask to Buy is a convenient feature that allows an Organizer to approve each Transaction initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country).
The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated.
Content downloaded from Family members or acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy.

G.
ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS
LICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT
App licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”).
If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International, the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International, which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International, but the App is licensed by the App Provider.
An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider.
Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”).
The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App.
You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement.
Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.
IN-APP PURCHASES 
Apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”).
In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once.
You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID.
You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you’ve asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID.
You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201304.

APP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT
Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law.
App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.

LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT
Apps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you.
Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided.
Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the Application Provider of that Third Party App.
Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.
a.
Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules.

You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).
b.
Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application.
Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.
c.

This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor.
Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.

Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services.
Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents.
You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party.
You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use.
External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location.
To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.

e.
NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.
NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
f.
Limitation of Liability.
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S.
Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List.
By using the Licensed Application, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.
You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.
h.
The Licensed Application and related documentation are "Commercial Items", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.

§12.212 or 48 C.F.R.

H.
ADDITIONAL IBOOKS STORE TERMS
You acquire iBooks Store Content from the third-party provider of such Content (the “Publisher”), not Apple.
Apple acts as an agent for the Publisher in providing iBooks Store Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Publisher.
If you are a customer of Apple Distribution International, the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International, which means that you acquire a license to use the Content from Apple Distribution International, but the Content is licensed by the Publisher.
The Publisher of the iBooks Store Content reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such iBooks Store Content.
The Publisher of the iBooks Store Content is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.

Apple reserves the right to cancel your Apple Music membership if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your membership.
Where available, you may be offered an Apple Music membership through your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”).
If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier will bill you for the cost of your Apple Music membership.
Your billing relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple.
By using Apple Music, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.
ICLOUD MUSIC LIBRARY
iCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or a third party (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices.
iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership.
iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content.
This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music.
iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple).
You can upload up to 100,000 songs.
Songs acquired from the iTunes Store or Apple Music do not count against this limit.
Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library.
When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use, and the time and duration of playback.
You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content.
iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies.

Sales Policies INTRODUCTION  These Terms of Use (“Terms”) provide important information about ordering goods or services (“Products”) from Apple, through any of Apple’s application-based services (the “Services”), so you should take the time to read and understand them.
You may review, save or print any part of these Terms.
We encourage you to print out a copy of this entire document and refer to it as you use the Services.


IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, SINCE YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CREATES A BINDING LEGAL AGREEMENT.
YOU MUST ACCEPT THESE TERMS IF YOU WISH TO USE ANY OF THE SERVICES.
IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU MUST DO SO AS THEY ARE PRESENTED TO YOU.
NO CHANGES (ADDITIONS OR DELETIONS) WILL BE ACCEPTED BY APPLE.
APPLICABLE LOCAL (NON-U.S.) LAW MAY ALTER OR AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF EITHER PARTY UNDER THESE TERMS.

 Apple may change, add or remove any part of these Terms at any time.
If it does so, Apple will post such changes on www.apple.com/internetservices/terms.
IF ANY FUTURE CHANGES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU SHOULD DISCONTINUE USING THE SERVICES.
YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICES NOW, OR FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF NOTICE OF ANY SUCH CHANGES, WILL INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS, AND OF ANY SUCH CHANGES.

 Your use of the Services is also subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy.
https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy.

 To use any of the Services, you must be at least 13 years old (or, for non-U.S.
users, such older minimum age as may be required by applicable local law).
If you are under the required age, you may still use the Services (subject to applicable local non-U.S.
law), but only if the account you are using was created and registered by your parent or legal guardian.


USING THE SERVICES
 When you accept these Terms and complete the One-Click™ registration process (if you have not already done so), you will be ready to use the Services.
Remember, do not reveal your Apple ID identifier or password to anyone else.
Your Apple ID account may be at risk if you let someone use this information inappropriately.


AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES
 While Apple will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available at all times, Apple does not guarantee, represent or warrant that your access to any of the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free.
In addition, while Apple makes reasonable efforts to ensure that all Content and/or information submitted by you to Apple will be secure, Apple does not guarantee that the Services will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses, “worms”, “trojan horses” or other harmful components, or from interference, hacking or other security intrusions.
You should be sure to back up your own system periodically to ensure that all Content is available to you in the event of any loss or damage.

 Apple may change, suspend or discontinue any of the Services at any time.
Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain features or portions of the Services, in any case without notice or liability.


ACCEPTABLE USE GUIDELINES
 There are rules and standards that you must abide by in connection with your use of the Services.
As a user of any of the Services, you agree to comply with the guidelines set forth in these Terms, and you acknowledge that Apple has the right to enforce those guidelines as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion.
This means that if you, or anyone using your account or identifying information, violate these Terms, Apple may take any and all actions -- from the issuance of a warning to terminating your right to use the Services to cancellation of your order for any Products and involvement of the appropriate authorities -- that Apple deems necessary or appropriate.
Apple may not be required to provide notice prior to terminating your right to use the Services for violating these Terms, but it may choose to do so (subject to applicable local U.S.
and non-U.S.
law).

 Apple reserves the right to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, including complying with warrants, court orders and subpoenas, in connection with the Services and/or any information or Content submitted by you to Apple in connection with your use of the Services and/or any order you may place for any Products through the Services.
If Apple decides to investigate or resolve possible misuse involving you or any information or any Content you submit to Apple with respect to your use of the Services, Apple may (subject to applicable local U.S.
or non-U.S.
law) disclose any information about you and any such information, including the content, to law enforcement or other government officials, as Apple, in its sole discretion, believes to be necessary or appropriate.

 BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LOCAL U.S.
AND NON-U.S.
LAW) TO WAIVE ANY CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST APPLE, AND TO HOLD APPLE HARMLESS AND INDEMNIFY APPLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO ANY ACTION TAKEN BY APPLE AS PART OF ITS INVESTIGATION OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION OF THIS AGREMENT OR AS A RESULT OF ITS FINDING OR DECISION THAT A VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT HAS OCCURRED.
THIS MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT SUE APPLE OR RECOVER ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER FROM APPLE AS A RESULT OF ITS DECISION TO REMOVE OR REFUSE TO PROCESS ANY INFORMATION OR CONENT, TO WARN YOU, TO SUSPEND OR TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES, OR TO TAKE ANY OTHER ACTION DURING THE INVESTIGATION OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION OR AS A RESULT OF APPLE’S CONCLUSION THAT A VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT HAS OCCURRED.
THIS WAIVER AND INDEMNITY PROVISION APPLIES TO ALL VIOLATIONS DESCRIBED IN OR CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.


DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.
LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
 YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

 If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
Apple’s failure to enforce any right or provisions in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such provision, or any other provision of these Terms.
Except as required by applicable non-U.S.
local or national law, the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern these Terms and your use of the Services.
Your use of the Services may also be subject to other local, state, national (U.S.

  Privacy Policy The Apple Privacy Policy was updated on May 22, 2018.
Your privacy is important to Apple so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.
In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information imbedded in our products for certain features that ask to use your personal information.
You can review this information before enabling these features, in Settings related to those features or online at apple.com/legal/privacy.

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.
 Your California Privacy Disclosures Information Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages in Canada
 Collection and Use of Personal InformationPersonal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.
You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Apple or an Apple affiliated company.
Apple and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
You are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.
Here are some examples of the types of personal information Apple may collect and how we may use it:What personal information we collect
When you create an Apple ID, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, register for a class at an Apple Retail Store, connect to our services, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifiers, IP address, location information and credit card information.
When you share your content with family and friends using Apple products, send gift certificates and products, or invite others to participate in Apple services or forums, Apple may collect the information you provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.
Apple will use such information to fulfill your requests, provide the relevant product or service, or for anti-fraud purposes.
In certain jurisdictions, we may ask for a government issued ID in limited circumstances including when setting up a wireless account and activating your device, for the purpose of extending commercial credit, managing reservations, or as required by law.
How we use your personal informationWe may process your personal information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy with your consent, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Apple is subject or when we have assessed it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Apple or a third party to whom it may be necessary to disclose information.

The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Apple’s latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events.
If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by updating your preferences.
We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.
We may also use your personal information for account and network security purposes, including in order to protect our services for the benefit of all our users.
Where we use your information for anti-fraud purposes it arises from the conduct of an online transaction with us.
We limit our uses of data for anti-fraud purposes to those which are strictly necessary and within our assessed legitimate interests to protect our customers and our services.
For certain online transactions we may also validate the information provided by you with publicly accessible sources.
We may use your personal information, including date of birth, to verify identity, assist with identification of users, and to determine appropriate services.
For example, we may use date of birth to determine the age of Apple ID account holders.
From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies.
Because this information is important to your interaction with Apple, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.
We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve Apple’s products, services, and customer communications.
If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.
Source of your personal information where they are not collected from youWe may have received your personal information from other persons if that person has shared their content with you using Apple products, sent gift certificates and products, or invited you to participate in Apple services or forums.
We may also validate the information provided by you when creating an Apple ID with a third party for security and fraud prevention purposes.
For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person.
When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted.
When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to re-identify individuals who may appear therein.Collection and Use of Non-Personal InformationWe also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.
We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.
The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:

We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where an Apple product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.
We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, iCloud services, our iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, App Store for Apple TV and iBooks Stores and from our other products and services.
This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.
Aggregated data is considered non‑personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.
This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.
Except in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.
With your explicit consent, we may collect data about how you use your device and applications in order to help app developers improve their apps.

If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.Cookies and Other TechnologiesApple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.
These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.
We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‑personal information.
However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.
Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News and in the App Store.
If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform, you can choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using.
If you enable Limit AdTracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads.
You may still see ads in the App Store or News based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading.
In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.
Apple and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.
Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Apple more convenient and personal.
For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Apple Online Store.
Knowing your country and language − and if you are an educator, your school − helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.
Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.
And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your iCloud service, and provide you with better customer service.
If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, go to Safari preferences and then to the privacy pane to manage your preferences.
On your Apple mobile device, go to Settings, then Safari, scroll down to the Privacy &amp.
Security section, and tap on “Block Cookies” to manage your preferences.
For other browsers, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.
Please note that certain features of the Apple website will not be available once cookies are disabled.
As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files.
This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
Apple may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Apple website.
When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.
We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.
If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.
We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.Disclosure to Third PartiesAt times Apple may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers.
For example, when you purchase and activate your iPhone, you authorize Apple and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service.
