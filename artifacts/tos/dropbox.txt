Let’s Try To Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.
Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com.
We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.
If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.

Judicial forum for disputes. You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below.
Both you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.
If you reside in a country (for example, European Union member states) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn’t affect those requirements.

IF YOU’RE A U.S.
RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:


We Both Agree To Arbitrate. You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.
This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.

Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account.
However, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.

Arbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.
The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.

Arbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000.
If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.
Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work.
Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim.


NO CLASS ACTIONS
.
You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.
If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be deemed void. Controlling Law These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles.
However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country.
This paragraph doesn’t override those laws. Entire Agreement These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.
These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Waiver, Severability &amp.
Assignment Dropbox’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.
If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.
You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.
Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Modifications We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:
(a) changes to the law,
(b) new regulatory requirements, or
(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.
If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we’ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification.
These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.
If you don’t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective.
Where applicable, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date.
By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
If your organization signed a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Enterprise Agreement with Dropbox, that Agreement may have modified the privacy policy below.

Thanks for using Dropbox! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of working by providing an intuitive, unified platform to collaborate with others and unleash your creative energy.
Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal information when you use our websites, software, and services (“Services”).
For more information and details, please see our Frequently Asked Questions page. What &amp.
Why We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, and protect our Services:

Account information. We collect, and associate with your account, the information you provide to us when you do things such as sign up for your account, upgrade to a paid plan, and set up two-factor authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).
Some of our Services let you access your accounts and your information via other service providers.

Your Stuff. Our Services are designed to make it simple for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (“Your Stuff”), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices.
To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it.
This related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.
Our Services provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff.

Contacts. You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services.
If you do, we’ll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.

Usage information. We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, and moving files or folders).
We use this information to improve our Services, develop new services and features, and protect Dropbox users.
Please refer to our FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information to improve our Services.

Device information. We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services.
This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices.
Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.

Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.
For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information.
You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we’ll respond to that signal as outlined here.

Marketing. We give users the option to use some of our Services free of charge.
These free Services are made possible by the fact that some users upgrade to one of our paid Services.
If you register for our free Services, we will, from time to time, send you information about upgrades when permissible.
Users who receive these marketing materials can opt out at any time.
If you do not want to receive marketing materials from us, simply click the ‘unsubscribe’ link in any email, or update your preferences in the Notifications section of your personal account.
We sometimes contact people who do not have a Dropbox account.

You can also share Your Stuff with other users if you choose.
When you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators and administrators find you and your team by making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address—visible to other users on the same domain.
This helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.
Certain features let you make additional information available to others.

Other applications. You can also give third-party providers access to your information and account—for example, via Dropbox APIs.
Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.

Please refer to your organization’s internal policies if you have questions about this.
If you are not a Dropbox team user but interact with a Dropbox team user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction.

  Dropbox Privacy Policy Posted: April 12, 2017
Effective: April 12, 2017
 Dropbox’s Privacy Policy will be changing effective May 25, 2018.
Click here to review.

 Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our websites, software and services ("Services").
 What &amp.
Why  We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services: 

Account.
We collect, and associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, physical address, and account activity.
Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers.


Services.
Our Services are designed to make it simple for you to store Your Stuff, collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices.
To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff—like files, messages, comments, and photos—as well as information related to it.
This related information can be things like your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others.
Our Services provide you with different options for sharing Your Stuff.

 You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services.
If you do, we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.


Usage.
We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, and moving files or folders).
This helps us provide you with features like the "Events" page and version history.

 We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services.
This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices.
Your devices (depending on their settings) may also transmit location information to the Services.


Cookies and other technologies.
We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services.
For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information.
You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
If our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond to that signal as outlined here.
 With whom  We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third parties.


Others working for Dropbox.
Dropbox uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.
These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we'll remain responsible for their handling of your information per our instructions.


Other users.
Our Services display information like your name, profile picture, and email address to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications.
When you register your Dropbox account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organization, we may help collaborators find you and your team by making some of your basic information—like your name, team name, profile picture, and email address—visible to other users on the same domain.
This helps us show you teams you can join, and helps other users share files and folders with you.

 Certain features let you make additional information available to others.


Other applications.
You can also give third parties access to your information and account - for example, via Dropbox APIs.
Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their privacy policies and terms.


Dropbox Team Admins. If you are a user of a Dropbox team (e.g., Dropbox Business plans or Dropbox Education), your administrator may have the ability to access and control your Dropbox team account.
Please refer to your organization's internal policies if you have questions about this.
If you are not a Dropbox team user but interact with a Dropbox team user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing stuff shared by that user), members of that organization may be able to view the name, email address, profile picture, and IP address that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction.


Law &amp.
Order.
We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law.
(b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury.
(c) prevent fraud or abuse of Dropbox or our users.
or (d) protect Dropbox's property rights.

 Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace.
We believe that our users' data should receive the same legal protections regardless of whether it's stored on our services or on their home computer's hard drive.
We'll abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving, scrutinizing and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for our users' data: 

Be transparent,
Fight blanket requests,
Protect all users and
Provide trusted services.
 We publish a Transparency Report as part of our commitment to informing users about when and how governments ask us for information.
This report details the types and numbers of requests we receive from law enforcement.
We encourage users to review our Government Request Principles and Transparency Report for more detailed information on our approach and response to government requests.

 How 
Security.
We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for vulnerabilities.
We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to things like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are linked to your account.


Retention.
We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide you the Services.
If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information.
But please note: (1) there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and back-up storage.
and (2) we may retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.
You can access your personal information by logging into your Dropbox account.
