Block List before we can assist you.
Fur Affinity Site Moderators will do everything they can to assist you in alleviating issues you may be experiencing on site with professionalism and without bias.
However, if at any time you disagree with a decision made by a member of staff, you may request that your issue be escalated to a Site Administrator for review or contact appeals@furaffinity.net with your user name and related ticket number.
Rulings are made based upon staff discretion after thorough investigation and reviewing site policies. The Law and You 1.1
Do not encourage or engage in illegal activity.
 This includes, but is not limited to, drug use (excluding marijuana use), piracy, and copyright infringement.
While you may openly debate the validity of current laws, you may not promote, encourage, engage in, plan, post or link to content or activities that violate federal US law, or anything that could be used as directions for committing a crime.



In other words...

Do not discuss, promote, or engage in illegal activity. 1.2
Do not discuss violent or sexual crimes.
 Do not discuss details or experiences of committing, illegal acts involving sex, violence, or abuse against any creature, living or dead.
Recounting and taking responsibility for past history may be permitted at staff discretion provided that harmful or illegal acts are not cast in a positive light.



In other words...

Similar to 1.1, do not discuss or promote acts of violent or sexual crimes. 1.3
Do not host or participate in any form of gambling.
 Gambling or games of chance are defined as requiring participants to pay an entry fee for a chance to win a prize but are not guaranteed to get a prize.
This may include raffles, sweepstakes, or lotteries.
Contests where entry is free or where all participants are guaranteed to receive a prize are permitted.



In other words...

Gambling is not permitted on the site.
You can run contests, but you can't charge people an entry fee unless they're guaranteed to receive an item. Other Users And You 2.1
Do not share or try to obtain private information.
 This includes posting or through deception attempting to obtain privileged personal information of other individuals, such as social security numbers, unlisted contact information, home addresses, credit card numbers, and personal correspondence (logs, emails, notes, etc).



In other words...

Respect other users' right to privacy.
Doxing or trying to post personally identifying information is not allowed. 2.2
Do not threaten anyone.
 This includes both physical and financial harm (theft or vandalism), alluded or explicit.



In other words...

Do not threaten others. 2.3
Do not stalk anyone.
 Stalking is the willful and repeated harassment of another user.
This harassment may also come in the form of repeated communication, following, and gifts to an unwilling recipient.



In other words...

Respect other users' right to personal space.
Do not stalk or harass them. 2.4
Do not harass anyone.
 In this context, harassment includes creating an account with an offensive name, impersonation of another user, and remarks which discuss personal grievances, quarrels, malicious rumors, or negative statements about other individuals.
This does not include civil discussions about topics of public interest such as celebrities or government officials, but does include 'bewares' and similar content.

Any attempt to address a user who has blocked you or whom you have blocked is considered a form of deliberate harassment.
This also includes soliciting other users to pass on messages or otherwise make contact on your behalf.
If a particular type of content does not appeal to you, then do not seek it out to make disparaging comments.
Users with a pattern of this behavior may be cited for harassment.


In other words...

Respect other users.
Don't spread rumors, misinformation, flame, or attempt to troll.
If a user has blocked you respect that block and move on.
Keep any and all discussion civil and polite. 2.5
Do not promote, glorify, instruct, or encourage anyone to hurt themselves.
 Do not encourage other users to engage in harmful behaviors, including suicide, eating disorders, or other forms of self harm.

This does not apply to fictional works when used as part of a narrative.



In other words...

Never encourage others to harm themselves. 2.6
Do not engage in malicious speech.
 Do not make pejorative use of slurs nor disparaging remarks about others' race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation or similar, or make maliciously misleading statements about cultures, religions, etc.

In other words...

Fur Affinity is a diverse community.
Respect the differences of others and keep all discussion civil regardless of differences. 2.7
Do not identify with or promote real hate or terrorist organizations and their ideologies.
 A hate group is one that advocates and practices hatred, hostility, or violence towards members of a designated sector of society (e.g.
Nazism, KKK, ISIS, Alt-Right).
Symbols of hate associated with these groups (e.g.
Swastika, Confederate Flag, etc.) will not be permitted in user avatars, real-life photographs (unless for historical education), and content intended solely to disrupt the community.
Users who identify with or promote real hate or terrorist organizations and their ideologies may be permanently banned from Fur Affinity without warning.



In other words...

Do not promote hate while on the site. Fur Affinity And You 3.1
Do not disrespect site staff or abuse the ticket system.
 Our staff is currently made up of volunteers who perform duties that are difficult and time consuming.
Please refrain from needless harassment, insults, and arguing as it interferes with the ability for staff to perform their duties.
Keep contact with staff concerning issues with Fur Affinity to the ticket system.
Do not misrepresent site policies or staff actions, suggest that you have special privilege with staff, or retaliate against other users over staff action.

Trouble ticket abuse includes opening multiple tickets for the same problem, using the prospect of a report as leverage against another user, and encouraging other users to create additional reports for the same violation.
If you disagree with a staff member's ruling you may ask to have an issue escalated but may not re-open the escalated ticket after a ruling is made.

If it's against the rules it can not be linked, except in instances noted. 3.4

You have a right request deletion
 You have a right to request that Fur Affinity delete your personal data that it holds.

We reserve the right to remove content from the site and we are not liable for any lost content. 1.3If for any reason, your account is suspended, banned, restricted, blocked (via users), or otherwise disabled by Fur Affinity, you agree to not create another account with the intent to bypass these limitations without our permission.
Any effort to evade these limitations may result in the termination of all current and future accounts you register.
