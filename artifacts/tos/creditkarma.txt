CREDIT KARMA AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, AND ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EQUITY HOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, PARENT ENTITIES, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATED ENTITIES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “CREDIT KARMA PARTIES”) WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (SUCH AS LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO OUR SERVICES, OUR CONTENT OR THE COMMUNITY CONTENT.

 Summary If someone sues us because of something you did, you're responsible for it, so read the above carefully.
 10.
Dispute Resolution and Arbitration  Summary A third party arbitrator will help us resolve any disputes we might have.
This means that any dispute will be resolved outside of class-action litigation.
Hopefully, disputes will never be an issue, but you should read this section carefully for details on how it works.
 10.1 Generally In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Credit Karma in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Credit Karma agree that every dispute arising in connection with the Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.
You and us further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.
Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.
Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.
Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of the Agreement.
The arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT, YOU AND CREDIT KARMA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
 10.2 Exceptions Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, you and us both agree that nothing in the Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court within its jurisdictional limits.
(b) file a complaint with the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.
(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration.
or (d) to file a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our Services or address an intellectual property infringement claim. 10.3 Arbitrator Any arbitration between you and Credit Karma will be governed by the FAA, the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Credit Karma here. 10.4 Notice and Process A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by certified mail ("Notice").
Credit Karma's address for Notice is: Credit Karma, Inc., P.O.
Box 520, San Francisco, CA 94104-0520, Attention: Legal Department.
The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.
and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").
You and Credit Karma agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Credit Karma do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or us may commence an arbitration proceeding.
During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Credit Karma must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Credit Karma's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, Credit Karma will pay you the amount awarded by the arbitrator or fifteen thousand United States dollars ($15,000), whichever is greater.
The arbitration proceedings, including any exchanged materials, shall be confidential and you and Credit Karma agree to use reasonable efforts to streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the objectives of efficient dispute resolution. 10.5 Fees If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, Credit Karma will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.
Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, or as otherwise required, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.
(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.
or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your registered account address.
If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
In that case, you agree to reimburse Credit Karma for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.
The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
 10.6 No Class Actions 
YOU AND CREDIT KARMA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.


Further, unless both you and Credit Karma agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. 10.7 Modifications If Credit Karma makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Credit Karma's address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Credit Karma's address for Notice, in which case your account with Credit Karma will be immediately terminated but this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive. 10.8 Enforceability If any provision of this Section 10 is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

Deactivation and Termination 11.1 Termination of Agreement.

immaterial modifications will take effect when published.
By continuing to use our Services following any modification to these terms, our Privacy Policy or any Additional Terms, you are agreeing to the Agreement as modified.
 12.4 Waiver Only in Writing Credit Karma's failure to enforce any of its rights or act with respect to a breach by you or others of the Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any rights and will not limit Credit Karma's rights with respect to that breach or any subsequent breaches.
No waiver by Credit Karma of any of the provisions in the Agreement will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Credit Karma.
 12.5 Assignment Credit Karma may assign the Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.
You may not assign your rights under the Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our consent.
 12.6 Severability If any provision of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
Nothing in the Agreement shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights or remedies that apply to you.
 12.7 Interpretation The titles and annotations, including the "Summary" sections, contained in these terms are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect.
The Agreement will not be construed against Credit Karma because we drafted it.
Whew! You made it.
Pat yourself on the back and then go enjoy Credit Karma!
