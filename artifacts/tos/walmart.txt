Walmart Privacy Policy Frequently Asked Questions &gt;

 What Does Our Privacy Policy Include? 

Our Policy covers how and why we collect, use, protect, and share your personal information:

At Walmart and Amigo retail stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, and&nbsp;
On our websites and mobile services where this Policy is posted.

Our Policy focuses on personal information – information that identifies you or reasonably can be linked to information that identifies you.
&nbsp;


 More For example, when you place an item on layaway or place an order online, we collect personal information, such as name, address, phone number, and credit or debit card information.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We have additional, specific privacy notices related to some of our specialized operations.
For example, our Health &amp.
Wellness operations (pharmacy and vision center) have a specific Notice of Privacy Practices for their personal information practices.&nbsp;Our specialized notices can be found&nbsp;here.
 What is Our pledge of Accountability? 

We require our associates, business partners, and service providers to manage your personal information properly.

 More We have designated a team of trained associates who are responsible for helping to ensure compliance with this Policy.&nbsp;We require all those who manage customers’ personal information to do so properly and in accordance with our policies.
 What Type of Information Do We Collect? 

We collect two types of information: (1) information we receive from you and (2) information we receive from others.
&nbsp;Information we receive from you includes information you share with us, such as when you create an account on one of our websites.&nbsp.
This also includes information you provide us through technology, such as through a cookie placed on your computer when you visit our websites.&nbsp.
We also receive information from other sources to help us supplement our records, improve the personalization of our service to you, and detect fraud.&nbsp.
Our goal is to limit the information we collect to the information needed to support our business.

 More We collect information to deliver the products and services you request and to help improve your shopping experience.
We collect information from you in a variety of ways when you interact with our stores, websites, and mobile services.

Information We Receive From You&nbsp;

You share information with us in various ways in our stores and online.
For example, you share information when you:&nbsp;

Some of this information may be linked to you personally.
This information helps our websites and mobile services work correctly and supports our customer marketing and analytics efforts – our work to understand our customers’ needs and provide information about our products and services.
Here are some examples:



Device Information: We collect technical information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications or services.

Browsing Information: We use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and mobile device identifiers to collect information about the use of our websites and mobile services.
&nbsp;Cookies allow us to provide you relevant information as you use or return to our sites.
Web beacons allow us to know if a certain page was visited, an email was opened, or if ad banners on our websites and other sites were effective.
We use these tools to provide a continuous and more personalized shopping experience for you.&nbsp;See “What Are Your Choices?” below for more information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;


Information We Receive From Other Sources

We receive information about you from other sources to help us correct or supplement our records, improve the quality or personalization of our service to you, and prevent or detect fraud.
&nbsp;We collect personal information from consumer reporting agencies in conjunction with products or services that involve financial risk to Walmart, such as transactions in which Walmart extends you financing.&nbsp;
 How Do We Use Your Personal Information? 

We use your personal information to provide you products and services, such as to fulfill your requests for products or to help us personalize our offerings to you.

Marketing Preferences
When we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following standards:

We use an opt-in standard for phone and text messages.
We use an opt-in standard for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing, such as sending you promotions.
Opt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent.&nbsp;
We use an opt-out standard for email or for other communications, such as postal mail.
Opt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below).&nbsp;

Please note that these standards may not apply to communications regarding our Health &amp.
Wellness operations, such as prescription reminders.
For more information see the&nbsp;Health &amp.
Wellness Notice of Privacy Practices.
Additionally, these standards may not apply to Walmart-branded credit card offerings because these are provided through associated financial institutions.
However, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to&nbsp;www.optoutprescreen.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

For instance, if you would like to opt-out of mail, include your mailing address.
Please allow sufficient time for your marketing preferences to be processed.
It may take up to ten days to process your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to telephone calls, text messages, and sharing information with your consent.
Please note that postal mailings are often prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks.
&nbsp;
Since we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties, such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one of the mechanisms mentioned above.
Please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes.
Some examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, customer surveys, or recalls.
We may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order.&nbsp;
