Get Epic GamesFan Content Policy
Everyone at Epic Games is extremely honored by the interest shown by our fans in our games and our company, and we think it’s cool that you want to create artwork, websites, and other stuff based on our intellectual property.
At the same time, we spend a lot of time, thought, and money creating our intellectual property and need to protect it.

In most cases, using our games, artwork, videos, music, characters, logos, and other intellectual property (“Epic IP”) without our permission is illegal and a violation of our rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we created this Policy to explain what you may do regarding your Fan Content.
In this Policy, “Fan Content” means: (i) your fan art (such as artwork, photographs, videos, and other materials) that is based on the Epic IP.
and (ii) your Epic IP-related personal, non-commercial websites and apps that are freely accessible to the public.

Please read this Policy carefully before creating any Fan Content.
We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time by posting the revised Policy to our website.
Any existing Fan Content that no longer complies with this Policy due to a change in the Policy must be modified to be compliant with the Policy.
&nbsp.
Section 1 – General Rules
1.1 You may create Fan Content based on Epic IP as long as you comply with this Policy.
Any Fan Content that violates this Policy is prohibited.

1.2 This Policy applies only to Epic IP that you access pursuant to Epic’s Terms of Service, end user license agreements, and/or other agreements you have with Epic.
For example, if you have agreed to Epic’s end user license agreement for particular game, then this Policy covers the Fan Content you create based on that game.

1.3 All Fan Content must be appropriate for the audience of the Epic IP and consistent with the spirit and tone of the Epic IP (as determined by Epic).
Fan Content must comply with applicable law, may not violate the rights of others, and must not be obscene, sexually explicit, defamatory, offensive, objectionable, or harmful to others.

1.4 Fan Content must have no commercial (i.e., monetary) objective.
As an exception to this, fans are permitted to monetize web videos (such as YouTube) with advertisements, so long as those videos otherwise meet the requirements of this Policy.

1.5 Epic, in its sole discretion, can revoke your permission to create Fan Content at any time and for any reason.

1.6 You may not say nor imply that your Fan Content is endorsed or approved by Epic.

1.7 Your Fan Content may not include links to any website that promotes or exploits cheats or hacks to Epic’s games or any other games.

1.8 You may not create or use any Fan Content in a manner that could cause people to believe that it is an official Epic production.
For example, a fan website may not be designed to look like an official Epic website, and it must be clear to visitors that the website is not an Epic website.

1.9 You may not use any Epic IP in any manner that is derogatory to Epic or that may damage the value, reputation, or goodwill of Epic or its products or brands (as determined by Epic).

1.10 You must display the following disclaimer on or in connection with your Fan Content, including on any web page containing your Fan Content:

Portions of the materials used are trademarks and/or copyrighted works of Epic Games, Inc.
All rights reserved by Epic.
This material is not official and is not endorsed by Epic.

Marks must be used only in connection with discussion of the Epic products or business they represent.
Do not use Marks to identify or promote you, your Fan Content, or any other products or business.
Marks must be used in a manner that will enhance and not damage the reputation and goodwill associated with the Marks.
Do not use any Marks in the name of a website unless it is clear from the name that the website is not an official Epic website.
Do not register or use any domain name that is confusingly similar to our domain names.
Do not alter any Marks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples: 
“Unreal Engine 4” should never be changed to “”Unreal 4 Engine” or “Unrealengine 4”.
The colors of a logo should not be altered, and the design and appearance of the logo should not be modified or adapted into a new logo.



&nbsp.
Section 2 – Your Agreements with Epic
Except for the limited permission described in Section 1 above, your use of any Epic IP is subject to Epic’s Terms of Service, end user license agreements, and other agreements you may have with Epic regarding the websites, games, and other materials from which you access the Epic IP.

&nbsp.
Section 3 - Mods
As you know, Epic allows fans to create modifications or enhancements (“Mods”) to some of our games pursuant to the end user license agreements for those games.

Binding Individual Arbitration.
No Class Actions
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.&nbsp.
IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Epic customer support at https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service.
But we understand that sometimes disputes can’t be easily resolved by customer support.
This Section explains how You and Epic agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration.

Arbitration is an alternative dispute-resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without the formality of going to court.
Any dispute between You and Epic is submitted to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) for fair and fast resolution.
Arbitration is more efficient for both you and Epic.

Disputes related to Epic’s End User License Agreement (“EULA”): If you have agreed to Epic’s End User License Agreement (“EULA”), “Disputes” as that term is defined in the EULA will be resolved as provided for in the EULA, including the EULA’s “Binding Individual Arbitration” section.&nbsp.
The dispute resolution terms below apply to disputes arising solely under these Terms and not to products or services governed by a EULA.
Disputes related to these Terms: If you have an issue related to these Terms and have not agreed to Epic’s EULA, the dispute-resolution terms below apply.&nbsp.

1.&nbsp.
Informal Resolution.


If you have an issue that our customer support can’t resolve, prior to starting arbitration You and Epic agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and control costs for both parties.
You and Epic agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (“Informal Resolution”).
Those informal negotiations will start on the day You or Epic receive a written Notice of a Dispute in accordance with these Terms.

You will send your Notice of Dispute to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A.
Include your name, any relevant account name you use, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want Epic to do.
If Epic has a dispute with You, Epic will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.

If you reside in the European Union (“EU”), You may also be entitled to submit Your complaint to the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform.
ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.

If the dispute isn’t resolved within by Informal Resolution or small-claims court (below), You or Epic may start an arbitration in accordance with these Terms.&nbsp.

2.&nbsp.
Small Claims Court

Instead of using Informal Resolution, You and Epic agree that You may sue us in small-claims court in your choice of the county where you live or Wake County, North Carolina (if you meet the requirements of small-claims court).
We hope you’ll try Informal Resolution first, but you don’t have to before going to small-claims court.
3.
Binding Individual Arbitration.&nbsp.

THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.
You and Epic agree that Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration&nbsp;conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.
(“JAMS”) subject to the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”) as modified by these Terms.

This means that You and Epic agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any Dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the Dispute.&nbsp.
JAMS uses experienced professionals to arbitrate disputes, which helps You and Epic resolve any disputes fairly, but more quickly and efficiently than going to court.&nbsp.
The arbitrator may award the same remedies to you individually as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act, and can enforced like any other court order or judgment.

3.1 Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate: 

You and Epic agree to submit all Disputes between You and Epic to individual binding arbitration.
“Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between You and Epic that relates to your use or attempted use of Epic’s products or services and Epic’s products and services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration section.

You and Epic agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.

The Informal Resolution and Arbitration sections do not apply to (1) individual actions in small-claims court.
(2) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows.
(3) a complaint or remedy under the EU&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation.
(4) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision.
(5) Epic’s right to seek injunctive relief against You in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds.
(6) claims of piracy, creation, distribution, or promotion of Cheats, and intellectual-property infringement, and (7) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.&nbsp.

You and Epic agree that whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under these Terms will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.
3.2 Arbitration Procedure: 

To start an arbitration, review the JAMS Rules and follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the JAMS website.
The party starting an arbitration must send JAMS a “Demand for Arbitration” (available on its website), pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party.
You will send a copy to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A.
Epic will send our copy to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.

The arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual-property and commercial-contract disputes.
You and Epic both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.
If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in Wake County, North Carolina, or where You reside.
you choose.
The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute.
Unless You and Epic agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.&nbsp.

The arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by You or Epic to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).&nbsp.
The arbitrator may not award relief against Epic respecting any person other than You.
Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement.

3.3 Arbitration Fees and Location: 

If You start the arbitration, you must pay the JAMS filing fee required for consumer arbitrations.

In some situations, Epic will help with your fees to (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly: 
If the Dispute involves $10,000 or less, Epic will pay all of the JAMS costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.

If the above doesn’t apply to You, but You demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs, Epic will pay as much of your JAMS costs as the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.

Even if Epic wins the arbitration and the applicable law or the JAMS Rules allow Epic to seek our portion of the JAMS fees from you, we won’t.

The fee assistance offered above is contingent upon You bringing the arbitration claim in “good faith”.
If the arbitrator finds You brought an arbitration claim against Epic for an improper purpose, frivolously, or without a sufficient pre-claim investigation into the facts or applicable law, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.&nbsp.

JAMS costs do not include your Attorneys’ fees and costs and Attorneys’ fees and JAMS costs are not counted when determining how much a dispute involves.

Epic won’t seek our attorneys’ fees or expenses from you in any arbitration, even if the law or the JAMS rules entitle us to do so.
If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise.&nbsp.

3.4 Notice and Filing. If a Dispute must be arbitrated, You or Epic must start arbitration of the Dispute within two (2) years from when the Dispute first arose.&nbsp.
If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period.&nbsp.
Epic encourages You to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it.
The failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.

3.5 Continuation in Effect.&nbsp; This Binding Individual Arbitration section survives any termination of these Terms or Epic’s provision of services to You.
3.6 Future Terms Changes.&nbsp; Although Epic may revise these Terms in its discretion, Epic does not have the right to alter these Terms to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises.
4.
Class Action Waiver.&nbsp.


To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You and Epic agree to only bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not:
seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions).
or
consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations.

5.
Severability.&nbsp;
&nbsp;If all or any provision of this Binding Individual Arbitration agreement is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then You and Epic agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included.&nbsp.
The sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, You and Epic agree that it will not be severable.
this entire Binding Individual Arbitration section will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in these Terms.&nbsp.
Under no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without Epic’s express consent.
Language
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms is English.
It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English.
Les parties déclarent qu'elles ont demandé et par les présentes confirment leur desir exprés que cette convention soit rédigee en anglais.
Any translation has been provided for your convenience.
&nbsp;
Waiver and Severability
No waiver of these Terms by Epic shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Epic to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.
&nbsp;

Get Epic GamesEPIC GAMES PRIVACY POLICY Last updated on September 10, 2019
Epic Games respects your concerns about privacy.
We’ve designed the Epic Games Privacy Policy to help you better understand the information we collect and the different ways we may use or share it.

This policy applies to your use of the Epic services.
By “Epic services,” we mean any of our websites, store, games, game engines, applications, or other products or services that link to this policy.
Additional terms and conditions may also apply to your relationship with Epic, depending on how you choose to interact with us.
Please read this entire policy to make sure you fully understand it.
You should also be sure to carefully review other terms potentially applicable to your visit (like the Terms of Service and any relevant End User License Agreements, such as the Fortnite EULA if you choose to play Fortnite), and confirm that you understand and agree to them, before using the Epic services.
Epic Games, Inc.
and our subsidiaries operate and support the Epic services from different locations around the world.
When we say “Epic” or “Epic Games,” we’re referring to the relevant Epic entity identified for your region in the “How to Contact Us” section of the policy below.
This Epic entity is responsible for providing the Epic services to you and is the controller of information collected under this policy.
&nbsp.

Please see “How to Contact Us” below to learn more about sending us any privacy-related questions or concerns you may have.

&nbsp; Information We Collect We only collect, use, share, store, or otherwise process your personal information when we have an appropriate basis.
For example, we may process your personal information as necessary to provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as our end user license agreements (like the Fortnite EULA if you choose to play Fortnite) or service terms and conditions (such as the Terms of Service).
We may process your personal information when necessary to comply with legal obligations or for purposes of pursuing legitimate interests, if doing so is consistent with your rights and appropriate to the context, such as providing services, addressing game performance, fixing bugs, performing internal analytics, and conducting reasonable monitoring of your use of our services to prevent misuse of the Epicservices and fraud.
Additionally, we may, in certain cases, ask you for your consent for certain processing of your personal information.
We generally collect information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (3) other parties, such as social networks, may provide information to us.
Each of these methods is described in more detail below.
&nbsp; (1) Information You Provide You may provide your personal information to us when you choose to use the Epic services.
Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with information also may change.
The following are some examples of situations in which you may provide information to us:

Creating an Epic account;
Licensing and downloading our games or game engines;
Using the Epic services’ social features (see “When You Use Social Features of the Epic Services”);
Purchasing something from us or otherwise engaging in a transaction with us;
Entering online competitions or registering for or participating in special events;
Entering contests or sweepstakes, participating in any of our promotions, or accepting any prizes from us;
Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive other information from us;
Completing a survey;
Using a mobile device, such as a phone, to play our games or use our applications;
Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service.

The personal information we collect from you will vary depending on the Epic services you are using and how you interact with them.
The information you provide to us may include your name, your display name, and your email address(es).
If you choose to make a purchase, we will collect payment card information such as your card’s payment account number and expiration date.
Sometimes we ask for your phone number, your postal address, your billing address, your date of birth, and your gender.
Some of our websites also provide a feature that supports job applications, in which case we also ask for your resume, name, and email address.
We use this information to determine if you are qualified for the position for which you applied or to contact you to set up an interview.
&nbsp; (2) Information We Collect Automatically We collect some information automatically when you visit the Epic services.
If a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information.
We typically aggregate the data that we collect automatically and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals.
We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, web beacons, and our back-end servers collect usage data transmitted from our games and other software.
We use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud or misuse of our services, and conducting data analytics.
The type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:

Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications);
Usage information and statistics about your interaction with the Epic services, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, and other usage statistics;
Crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a game or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash;
Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as your display name or other user identification provided in connection with your application use or game play, saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes;
The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device’s IP address.

Please note that if certain features on the Epic services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the Epic services or others’ websites over time.
These features are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.
&nbsp; (3) Information We Receive from Others In some cases, other parties provide us with information about you, or allow us to collect information about you.
We generally collect information from other parties in four ways: (1) you access the Epic services using a website or device that is not controlled by us, such as a game console or social network, (2) you choose to use a social feature of the Epic services, (3) you purchase one of our games or applications from another party, or (4) you use Epic services that contain or require anti-cheat services from other parties.
In some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties like social networks, make available to us.
In those cases, we use only the data that we need to provide the types of services we think our users want and expect.
Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.
&nbsp;
When You Access the Epic Services at Third Party Websites
When you use any Epic service at a website not controlled by Epic, such as a social network, that website may allow Epic access to certain information about you.
For example, social networks may provide us with information from your profile on their website such as contact information, demographics, and other information you provided to that website such as your photo, user name, and potentially any and all information that you agreed the social network or other party could provide to us when you use our games and applications.
&nbsp;
When You Use Social Features of the Epic Services
When you choose to use some of the Epic services’ social features, you allow Epic to receive information about you from third parties (like social networks).
Our social features promote and facilitate interaction among players, such as by allowing you and your friends to work together to meet a shared challenge presented by our game or application.
You may be able to use these features to find out if your friends are actively playing the game and using the feature, to find out if they used it in the past, and to invite them to join with you to meet a game challenge.
If you choose to use one of our social features, you may be asked to log into a social network through our game or application.
The social network may then provide Epic with information such as your social network user ID, your profile picture, and the user IDs and profile pictures of your connections.
&nbsp;
When You Buy Our Games and Applications from Other Parties
We may also receive information about you from the organizations that sell our games or applications, or which provided the gaming system you use.
Those parties may provide us with information regarding your account or registration, but they do not give us your payment information.
Because those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but it is likely to include information such as your name, email address, user ID, location, and date of birth.
&nbsp;
When You Use Our Games that Contain or Require Anti-Cheat Services from Other Parties
Certain of our games contain or require third party anti-cheat services.
These services may collect and analyze data about the game binary or your computer to detect cheating and may share some of this information with us.
However, these anti-cheat service providers perform anti-cheat analysis independently of Epic or its subsidiaries and therefore are independent controllers of the data that they collect from you.
If cheating is detected, these service providers will provide information to Epic that is necessary to identify the relevant account.
In addition, the service providers may make available to Epic information to evidence the detected cheating.
We currently use BattlEye as such a service provider in some of our games.
You can find out about BattlEye’s privacy practices and contact information at its privacy policy: https://www.battleye.com/privacy-policy/.
Additional information about BattlEye can be found in the Third Party Notices within games that use BattlEye.
&nbsp; How We Use and Share Information As a general matter, we use your information to provide the services, experiences, merchandise, or information you request.
We also may use your information for the following purposes.

To support our legitimate interests, consistent with your rights and preferences, we use personal information:


To communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with updates and information;
To better understand our users, their interests, and their preferences;
To personalize your experience, save your preferences, authenticate our users, and provide similar user-experience features;
To develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings, some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties;
To manage and customize advertisements or promotional offers;
For security purposes;
For internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.


To provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as enforcing our licenses, agreements, and terms of service, which may include reasonable monitoring to detect and prevent misuse or fraud and to keep our games fair for all users.


To the extent you give consent, such as when we would like to process your personal information for a purpose that would otherwise be incompatible with this policy.


To comply with legal obligations.

We store personal information for as long as we reasonably need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
For example, if you register for our services and create an account, we will store your information for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the services you requested, enforce any applicable terms that govern your use of the services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our delivery of services to you.
We periodically review the personal information we retain to determine whether continued storage is proper.
We may share, or provide you with opportunities to share, information about you with other users of the Epic services as described in this policy.
We also provide services that allow our users to communicate with Epic and each other, in which case personal information may be shared and account IDs may be displayed.
We may share personal information we collect with Epic Games, Inc.
subsidiaries to support the Epic services worldwide.
We also will share information with service providers that perform services on our behalf and under our instructions.
These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
We also may share certain limited information, such as device identifiers, with advertisers and other marketing partners for purposes of gauging the effectiveness of advertising and other marketing strategies.
If you purchase a game from the Epic Games store, we may share your information with the developer or publisher of the game to support your gameplay and permit them to contact you for appropriate purposes.
For example, we will share your contact information and preferred language with the developer or publisher of the game to allow them to send you transactional communications related to the game.
Developers and publishers also may, with your consent or subject to their privacy obligations, send you other communications related to the developer or publisher’s other games or products, which you may opt out of at any time.
In addition, we may provide the developer or publisher with information necessary to support gameplay, multiplayer gameplay, or social features within the game, such as your Epic account ID, display name, and your friends list (if your friends also have purchased the same game from the relevant developer or publisher).
If the developer or publisher remove their game from the Epic Games store, we also will transfer personal data to these independent publishers or developers if necessary to support your continued gameplay on another platform.
When Epic provides your information to these independent developers and publishers, their use and disclosure of it is governed by limitations in our agreements with them.
However, they also provide their end users with privacy notices or policies that govern their use of your information.
Personal information you share with them or that is not provided by Epic will be subject to the developers’ and publishers’ privacy notices and policies, and may not be subject to this policy.
We may share information about you with your social network contacts when you and they use the same social features of our games and applications.
We may also disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, or a reasonable request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or (iii) if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual (such as to prevent death, bodily harm, or serious damage to property).
We reserve the right to transfer information about our users in the event we sell or transfer all or substantially all our business or assets.
&nbsp; Your Choices We provide you with choices about whether to provide us with personal information and whether it is shared.
For example, we may seek your prior consent for certain processing.
We are required to seek your consent before we use your personal information for any purpose incompatible with the purposes identified in this policy.
You may withdraw your consent at any time by sending an email as specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
Any withdrawal of consent is only effective on a going-forward basis and will not impact processing we undertook while relying on your consent.
We generally only ask you for personal information that is necessary to provide the services you request.
You can choose not to give us the personal information we request, as described in the “Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide” section of this policy.
However, in some cases, if you decide not to provide the personal information we request, we will not be able to provide the game, application, service, information, or features you requested.
&nbsp.
&nbsp;
Other examples of your choices include:

You can browse our website without providing any personal information.
We may collect some limited information automatically, as described above.
You may opt out of receiving our messages at any time by using the opt-out mechanism provided in the message.
You can change your privacy settings on other parties’ websites, such as social networks, which will stop or limit our receipt of information from those other websites.
You also may choose not to use social features we make available.
If you choose to use these features, you should refrain from posting personal information that will be visible to others, such as including your email address in a forum or during a chat.
You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies.
Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser “do not track” signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.
In some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause our websites, games, and applications not to work as intended and some features may not be available.
You can limit interest-based advertising by opting out at www.aboutads.info/choices/ or www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
If you are located in Europe, more information is available at www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
If you are under the age of 18 and have an account for our websites, mobile apps, game engines, games, or other online services, you may request that we remove certain content that you provided, such as deleting or editing comments you have posted.
You also may ask us to assist you in removing or anonymizing content you have posted by contacting us as described in the How to Contact us section of this policy.
Please be aware that taking these steps may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on our websites, online services, applications, or games.
We also may not be able to remove content you post if applicable law requires us to maintain the posting or if another party has re-posted the content to a website, app, game or other online service that we do not own or control.

You may also exercise and amend your choices by sending an email to us as detailed in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
&nbsp; Access and Correction We provide you with the ability to request access to and correction of your personal information.
You can update your account information any time through our website.
If you would like to request access to or correction of your personal information, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
Please include your name, email address, and postal address in your request, and describe specifically the information that you would like to access or correct so that we may respond appropriately and promptly.
&nbsp; How We Protect Personal Information We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use and other unlawful forms of processing.
In some cases, your information is accessible when you log into a feature we offer, and in those cases you need to keep your user credentials and password confidential and secure so that your information is protected.

&nbsp; Children’s Privacy The Epic services are intended to be appropriate for general audiences and are not directed to children (usually considered to be under 13, depending on where you reside).
Epic does not intentionally collect personal information from children without seeking any required parental approval in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, such as the U.S.
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).
We may ask you to provide age-related information in order to help us comply with laws like COPPA.
For example, we may request your date of birth to determine whether COPPA requires us to obtain verifiable parental consent from your parent or guardian before allowing you to access the Epic services.
If a user indicates they are a COPPA minor, we’ll require that user to complete a parental approval process before continuing to access the relevant Epic services.
This process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to the Epic services, inform them about Epic’s privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve Epic’s collection and use of their child’s information as described in this policy, and describe the controls that we make available to them.

Once a parent provides their consent, we’ll give them an opportunity to review and change important account settings that control how their child can interact with the Epic services.
To learn more, see https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/parental-controls.
Parents are also generally free to change or revoke the choices they’ve previously made, and can review the personal information associated with their child’s account or request that we delete it from our systems.
To submit these requests or ask us any other questions you may have about how we handle your child’s personal information, please see “How to Contact Us” below.
Authorized child accounts are otherwise treated much like other Epic accounts.
They can generally play approved games (such as Fortnite), access communications and social features (like chat and friends lists), and freely interact with most of the Epic services (including downloading other games from the Epic Games Store).
For additional details, please see the “Information We Collect” and “How We Use and Share Information” sections of the policy above.
&nbsp; Transfers of Information Epic Games is a company with operations around the world.
By using the Epic services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be processed outside your country of residence, including in other jurisdictions (like the United States) that may have different data protection frameworks than your region.
To learn more about the Epic entity responsible for operating the Epic services in your region, see “How to Contact Us” below.
We’ve implemented and maintain a framework consistent with applicable law and this policy for transfers of information outside the country of collection.
For example, when we transfer personal data collected in the European Union to locations outside the European Economic Area, we rely on transfer mechanisms adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards, like Standard Contractual Clauses.
We may also need to transfer your information to provide the Epic services to you in accordance with our existing agreements with you, such as the Terms of Service.

&nbsp; Additional Privacy Rights and Obligations If you are located in the EU or the Epic entities located in the EU process your personal information in the EU, then you have the right to restrict or object to our processing of your personal information.
The right to restrict processing arises only in limited circumstances, for example, if you think we are processing inaccurate information.
&nbsp;In addition, if we are required to restrict processing but the requirement is temporary, we may not be permanently obligated to adhere to your request.
We will, however, let you know when the restriction is lifted.
In cases where our basis for processing your information is the satisfaction of our legitimate interests (e.g., fraud prevention), you may object to our processing.
However, we will decline your request if our interest in continuing to process your information is sufficiently compelling to legally override your interest in the request, or our processing is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.
You also may prevent us from sending direct marketing at any time without limitation.
&nbsp;To request a restriction or to object to processing, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
Similarly, if you are located in the EU or Epic entities located in the EU process your personal information, then we will provide you with the ability to request access to and correction or deletion of your personal information.
If you have an account with us, you can access and update your account information any time by logging into your account through our website.
You also may request that we provide you with a copy of your personal information, or update it or delete it on your behalf.
Your right to request access, correction, or deletion is sometimes limited.
For example, we will not provide you with access to information that includes personal information about another person, and we will keep limited personal information notwithstanding a request to delete if necessary for us to establish, exercise, or defend against a legal claim.
To request access to, or correction or deletion of your personal information, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.

Individuals located in the EU or whose personal information is processed by Epic in the EU also have the right to obtain their personal information so they can transfer it to another party, or ask us to do so on their behalf, which we will do when technically feasible.
This right is limited, and only arises when our processing of your information is automated and based on your consent or our user agreements and/or terms and conditions.
To exercise this right, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
To the extent French data protection law is applicable to you, you have the right to establish instructions in respect of the preservation, the deletion and the transmission of your personal data after your death.
To exercise this right, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
Epic has appointed a data protection officer to address questions and requests related to our implementation of EU data protection requirements.
Individuals located in the EU can contact our data protection officer with any questions or concerns about how we process their personal information via email at dpo@epicgames.com.
Individuals located in the EU also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority established in their country.
&nbsp; Updates to Our Privacy Policy This policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices or relevant laws.
We will indicate at the top of this policy when this policy was last updated.
Please review this policy every time you access or use the Epic services to make sure that you have reviewed the most recent version.
&nbsp; How to Contact Us If you have general questions or concerns about the Epic services (such as game-related issues, trouble accessing your Epic account, bugs or other technical problems, payment matters, or content and entitlement issues), please contact our Player Support team.
To learn more about Epic’s privacy practices or this policy, please email your questions to privacy@epicgames.com&nbsp;or send them to us via postal mail (marked “Attn: Legal Department”) at the appropriate address listed below.
You can also contact our Data Protection Officer directly at dpo@epicgames.com.

 Epic Games Global Privacy Policy  Last updated on May 24, 2018 Epic Games respects your concerns about privacy.
We want you to understand the types of information we collect, how we use that information, how we secure it, and whether we share it.
When you use our websites, games, game engines, and applications, you agree to our collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of information as described in this policy, so please review it carefully.
This policy applies to Epic Games, Inc.
and its corporate subsidiaries and affiliates (Epic Games International, S.à r.l., Chair Entertainment Group LLC, Epic Games Canada, Epic Games China, Epic Games Germany GmbH, Epic Games Japan, Epic Games Korea, and Epic Games UK Ltd) (collectively, “Epic”), but does not apply to our websites, games or applications that have their own separate privacy policies or notices.

If you reside in the United States of America, the controller of your information under this policy is Epic Games, Inc., located at 620 Crossroads Blvd., Cary, NC 27518, USA.
 If you reside outside of the United States of America, the controller of your information under this policy is Epic Games International S.à r.l., a Luxembourg Société à Responsibilité Limitée, located at Atrium Business Park, 33 rue du Puits Romain, L8070 Bertrange, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, acting through its Swiss branch, having its principal business offices at Lindenstrasse 16, 6340 Baar, Switzerland.
 
Please contact us if you have any questions.
 Information We Collect or Receive We only collect, use, share, store, or otherwise process your personal information when we have an appropriate basis.
For example, we may process your personal information as necessary to provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as our end user license agreements or service terms and conditions.
We may process your personal information when necessary to comply with legal obligations or for purposes of pursuing legitimate interests, if doing so is consistent with your rights and appropriate to the context, such as providing services, addressing game performance, fixing bugs, performing internal analytics, and conducting reasonable monitoring of your use of our services to prevent misuse of our services and fraud.
Additionally, we may, in certain cases, ask you for your consent for certain processing of your personal information.
We generally collect or receive information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (3) other parties, such as social networks, may provide information to us.
Each of these methods is described in more detail below. (1) Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide You may provide your personal information to us when you choose to use our websites, games, game engines, or applications.
Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with information also may change.
The following are some examples of situations in which you may provide information to us:

Creating an account to use our websites, online services, software, or applications;
Licensing and downloading our games or game engines;
Using a social feature of our games or applications (described further in the section of this policy titled “When You Use Social Features of Our Games and Applications”).

Purchasing something from us or otherwise engaging in a transaction with us.

Entering online competitions or registering for or participating in special events.

Entering contests or sweepstakes, participating in any of our promotions, or accepting any prizes from us.

Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive other information from us.

Completing a survey.

Using a mobile device, such as a phone, to play our games or use our applications.

Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service.

The personal information we collect from you will vary depending on the services you are using, the websites you are visiting, and how you access those services and websites.
The information you provide to us may include your name, your display name, and your email address(es).
If you choose to make a purchase, we will collect payment card information such as your card’s payment account number and expiration date.
Sometimes we ask for your phone number, your postal address, your billing address, your date of birth, and your gender.

Some of our websites also provide a feature that supports job applications, in which case we also ask for your resume, name, and email address.
We use this information to determine if you are qualified for the position for which you applied or to contact you to set up an interview. (2) Information Collected Automatically When You Use Our Websites, Games, and Applications We collect some information automatically when you visit our websites or use our games, game engines, and applications.
If a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information.
We typically aggregate the data that we collect automatically and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals.
We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, web beacons, and our back-end servers collect usage data transmitted from our games and other software.
We use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud or misuse of our services, and conducting data analytics.
The type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:

Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications);
Usage information and statistics about your interaction with our websites, games, game engines, and applications, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, and other usage statistics.

Crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a game or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash;
Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as your display name or other user identification provided in connection with your application use or game play, saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes;
The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device’s IP address.

Please note that if certain features on our website are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of our website or others’ websites over time.
These features are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies. (3) Information We Receive from Others In some cases, other parties provide us with information about you, or allow us to collect information about you.
We generally collect or receive information from other parties in four ways: (1) you use our games or applications using a website or device that is not controlled by us, such as a game console or social network, (2) you choose to use a social feature of our games or applications, (3) you purchase one of our games or applications from another party, or (4) you use our games that contain or require anti-cheat services from other parties.
In some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties like social networks, make available to us.
In those cases, we use only the data that we need to provide the types of services we think our users want and expect.
Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.

When You Use Our Games and Applications at Third Party Websites

When you use any Epic game, application, or feature at a website not controlled by Epic, such as a social network, that website may allow Epic access to certain information about you.
For example, social networks may provide us with information from your profile on their website such as contact information, demographics, and other information you provided to that website such as your photo, user name, and potentially any and all information that you agreed the social network or other party could provide to us when you use our games and applications.

When You Use Social Features of Our Games and Applications

When you choose to use a social feature of our games and applications, you allow Epic to receive information about you from social networks.
Our social features promote and facilitate interaction among players, such as by allowing you and your friends to work together to meet a shared challenge presented by our game or application.
You may be able to use these features to find out if your friends are actively playing the game and using the feature, to find out if they used it in the past, and to invite them to join with you to meet a game challenge.
If you choose to use one of our social features, you may be asked to log into a social network through our game or application.
The social network may then provide Epic with information such as your social network user ID, your profile picture, and the user IDs and profile pictures of your connections.


When You Buy Our Games and Applications from Other Parties

We may also receive information about you from the organizations that sell our games or applications, or which provided the gaming system you use.
Those parties may provide us with information regarding your account or registration, but they do not give us your payment information.
Because those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but it is likely to include information such as your name, email address, user ID, location, and date of birth.

When You Use Our Games that Contain or Require Anti-Cheat Services from Other Parties

Certain of our games contain or require third party anti-cheat services.
These services may collect and analyze data about the game binary or your computer to detect cheating and may share some of this information with us.
However, these anti-cheat service providers perform anti-cheat analysis independently of Epic and therefore are independent controllers of the data that they collect from you.
If cheating is detected, these service providers will provide information to Epic that is necessary to identify the relevant account.
In addition, the service providers may make available to Epic information to evidence the detected cheating.
We currently use one or both of BattlEye and EasyAntiCheat in some of our games.
You can find out about the privacy practices and contact information of these service providers at their respective privacy policies: https://www.battleye.com/privacy-policy/ and http://www.easyanticheat.net/privacy/.
Additional information about BattlEye can be found in the Third Party Notices within games that use BattlEye. How We Use and Share Information As a general matter, we use your information to provide the services, experiences, merchandise, or information you request.
We also may use your information for the following purposes.

For our legitimate interests, consistent with your rights and preferences, we use personal data:


To communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with updates and information.

To better understand our users, their interests, and their preferences.

To personalize your experience, save your preferences, authenticate our users, and provide similar user-experience features.

To develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings.

To manage and customize advertisements or promotional offers;
For security purposes.

For internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.



To provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as enforcing our licenses, agreements, and terms of service, which may include reasonable monitoring to detect and prevent misuse or fraud and to keep our games fair for all users.


To the extent you give consent, such as when we would like to process your personal information for a purpose that would otherwise be incompatible with this policy.


To comply with legal obligations.

We store personal information for as long as we reasonably need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.
For example, if you register for our services and create an account, we will store your information for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the services you requested, enforce any applicable terms that govern your use of the services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our delivery of services to you.
We periodically review the personal information we retain to determine whether continued storage is proper.
We may share, or provide you with opportunities to share, information about you with other users of our websites, games, game engines, and applications as described in this policy.
We also provide services that allow our users to communicate with Epic and each other, in which case personal information may be shared and account IDs may be displayed.
We may share personal information we collect within our family of companies.
We also will share information with service providers that perform services on our behalf and under our instructions.
These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
We also may share certain limited information, such as device identifiers, with advertisers and other marketing partners for purposes of gauging the effectiveness of advertising and other marketing strategies.
We may share information about you with your social network contacts when you and they use the same social features of our games and applications.
We may also disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, or a reasonable request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or (iii) if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual (such as to prevent death, bodily harm, or serious damage to property).
We reserve the right to transfer information about our users in the event we sell or transfer all or substantially all our business or assets. Your Choices We provide you with choices about whether to provide us with personal information and whether it is shared.
For example, we may seek your prior consent for certain processing.
We are required to seek your consent before we use your personal information for any purpose incompatible with the purposes identified in this policy.
You may withdraw your consent at any time by sending an email as specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
Any withdrawal of consent is only effective on a going-forward basis and will not impact processing we undertook while relying on your consent.
We generally only ask you for personal information that is necessary to provide the services you request.
You can choose not to give us the personal information we request, as described in the “Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide” section of this policy.
However, in some cases, if you decide not to provide the personal information we request, we will not be able to provide the game, application, service, information, or features you requested.
   
Other examples of your choices include:

You can browse our website without providing any personal information.
We may collect some limited information automatically, as described above.

If you choose to use these features, you should refrain from posting personal information that will be visible to others, such as including your email address in a forum or during a chat.
You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies.
Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser “do not track” signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.
In some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause our websites, games, and applications not to work as intended and some features may not be available.
You can limit interest-based advertising by opting out at www.aboutads.info/choices/ or www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
If you are located in Europe, more information is available at www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
If you are under the age of 18 and have an account for our websites, mobile apps, game engines, games, or other online services, you may request that we remove certain content that you provided, such as deleting or editing comments you have posted.
You also may ask us to assist you in removing or anonymizing content you have posted by contacting us as described in the How to Contact us section of this policy.
Please be aware that taking these steps may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on our websites, online services, applications, or games.
We also may not be able to remove content you post if applicable law requires us to maintain the posting or if another party has re-posted the content to a website, app, game or other online service that we do not own or control.

You may also exercise and amend your choices by sending an email to us as detailed in the “How to Contact Us” section below. Access and Correction We provide you with the ability to request access to and correction of your personal information.

Please include your name, email address, and postal address in your request, and describe specifically the information that you would like to access or correct so that we may respond appropriately and promptly.
 How We Protect Personal Information We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use and other unlawful forms of processing.
In some cases, your information is accessible when you log into a feature we offer, and in those cases you need to keep your user credentials and password confidential and secure so that your information is protected.  Children’s Privacy Epic does not direct its websites, games, game engines, or applications to children (usually considered to be under the age of 13, depending on the country where you reside).
We also do not intentionally collect personal information from children through our websites, games, game engines, or applications.

We will transfer your personal information for any of the purposes identified in this policy to our subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers, and business partners that may be located outside of the jurisdiction where you are located.
 The laws in those jurisdictions may not provide the same level of data protection compared to the laws in your country.
 However, we will treat your personal information as subject to the protections described in this policy.

When we transfer personal information from the EU to entities within our organization located outside of the EU, we rely on standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards.
If we transfer personal information from the EU to another party located outside the EU, we will rely on a legal framework that provides appropriate safeguards, which could include the standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, the EU-U.S.
Privacy Shield program, or another framework deemed adequate by the European Commission.

We will, however, let you know when the restriction is lifted.
In cases where our basis for processing your information is the satisfaction of our legitimate interests (e.g., fraud prevention), you may object to our processing.

To request access to, or correction or deletion of your personal information, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
