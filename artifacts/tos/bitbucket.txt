Effective starting: November 1, 2018 
Thanks for using Atlassian’s Cloud Products!  These Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service (these “Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products.
As applicable to the specific Cloud Product, if you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Atlassian customer, the User Notice governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms).  These Terms are between you and the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here (“Atlassian”, “we” or “us”).  “You” means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.  If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms.
(ii) you have read and understand these Terms.
and (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent.
If you don’t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.  PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD “YOU” IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.



These Terms are effective as of the date you first click “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) or use or access a Cloud Product, whichever is earlier (the “Effective Date”).
These Terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding.
You indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking “I agree” (or similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Cloud Product, create a Cloud Product account, or place an Order. For No-Charge Products, you also indicate your assent to these Terms by accessing or using the applicable No-Charge Product.  



1.
What these Terms cover.


1.1. Cloud Products.
These Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services.
These Terms include Our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.

1.2. Product-Specific Terms. Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms.
By accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.

1.3. Software Products Not Covered.
These Terms do not apply to our downloadable software products (currently designated as “Server” and “Data Center” deployments), use of which requires a separate license agreement with us.
For clarity, however, any client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) we provide as part of the Cloud Products themselves remains subject to these Terms.

2.
How Cloud Products are administered.


2.1.
Administrators.
Through the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts.
This may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees).
creating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions.
and managing access to Your Data by End Users or others.
Administrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become “managed accounts”, as described in our Documentation).
Without limiting Section 2.4 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above.
You agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.

2.2. Reseller as Administrator.
If you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.  As between you and Atlassian, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.

2.3. End User Consent. You will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.
and (ii) Atlassian’s provision of the Cloud Products to Administrators and End Users.
You will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request. 

2.4. Responsibility for End Users.
Our Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows.
Some Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators.
some allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time.
and some may allow users to invite other users.
You are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User.
If payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products.
Some Cloud Products may allow you to designate different types of End Users (for example, Jira Service Desk distinguishes between “agents” and “customers”), in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User.
You are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations.
Please note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain.
We may display our User Notice to End Users at sign up, account creation, Cloud Product registration, or in-product.
If you use single sign-on (SSO) for identity management of your Cloud Product(s) such that End Users will bypass these screens and our User Notice, you are responsible for displaying our User Notice to End Users and for any damages resulting from your failure to do so.

2.5. Credentials. You must require that all End Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Products strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person.
User IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared.
You are responsible for any and all actions taken using End User Accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.

2.6. Age Requirement for End Users. The Cloud Products are not intended for, and should not be used by, anyone under the age of 16.
You are responsible for ensuring that all End Users are at least 16 years old.

2.7. Domain Name Ownership. Where you are required to specify a domain for the operation of a Cloud Product or certain Cloud Product features, we may verify that you own or control that domain.
If you do not own or control the domain you specify, then we will have no obligation to provide you with the Cloud Product or Cloud Product features.

Solely to the extent that reformatting Your Data for display in a Cloud Product constitutes a modification or derivative work, the foregoing license also includes the right to make modifications and derivative works.
We may also access your accounts, End User Accounts, and your Cloud Products with End User permission in order to respond to your support requests.

5.3.
No Sensitive Data. You will not submit to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to collect) any Sensitive Data.
You also acknowledge that we are not acting as your Business Associate or subcontractor (as such terms are defined and used in HIPAA).
The Cloud Products are neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant.
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, we have no liability under these Terms for Sensitive Data.

5.4.
Your Indemnity. You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless us (and our Affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) resulting from any claim arising from or related to (i) your breach of Section 2.3 (End User Consent) or any claims or disputes brought by your End Users arising out of their use of Cloud Products, (ii) your breach (or alleged breach) of Sections 5.2 (Your Data Compliance Obligations) or 5.3 (No Sensitive Data).

We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of removals and suspensions when practicable, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Cloud Product or other users, we may suspend your access or remove Your Data immediately without notice.

Your receipt or use of any third party products or services (and the third parties’ use of any of Your Data) is subject to a separate agreement between you and the third party provider.
If you enable or use third party products or services with the Cloud Products (including Third Party Apps as referenced in Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)), we will allow the third party providers to access or use Your Data as required for the interoperation of their products and services with the Cloud Products.

6.2. Marketplace Apps.
As further described in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, the Atlassian Marketplace lists a variety of Apps that may be used with Cloud Products, including both Atlassian Apps and Third Party Apps.
Atlassian Apps for Cloud Products are considered “Cloud Products” under these Terms (unless we specify otherwise through the Atlassian Marketplace).
Third Party Apps are not Cloud Products and remain subject to their own applicable Vendor Terms.
We may enable interoperation of the Cloud Products with Third Party Apps as set forth in Section 6.1 (Third-Party Products).

If you do not provide us with timely access to Your Materials, our performance of Additional Services will be excused until you do so.

Billing, renewals, and payment.


9.1.
Monthly and Annual Plans.
Except for No-Charge Products, all Cloud Products are offered either on a monthly subscription basis or an annual subscription basis.

9.2.
Renewals. Except as otherwise specified in your Order, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to expiration of the current Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term of a period equal to your initial Subscription Term.
You will provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which may include account settings in the Cloud Products or contacting our support team.
Cancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged.
All renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.

9.3.
Adding Users. You may add users, increase storage limits, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.

9.4.
Payment. You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order.
If a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Atlassian by emailing the PO number to accountsreceivable@atlassian.com.
For Additional Services provided at any non-Atlassian location, unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will reimburse us for our pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses, which we may charge as incurred.
Other than as expressly set forth in Section 10 (Our return policy), 18.3 (Warranty Remedy), Section 20 (IP Indemnification) or Section 24 (Changes to these Terms), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.
You agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.

9.5.
Delivery. We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees.
You are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed.
All deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.

10.
Our return policy. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty in Section 18 (Warranties and Disclaimer), you may terminate your initial Order of a Cloud Product under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such Cloud Product.
In the event you terminate your initial Order under this Section 10, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the amount paid under such Order.
This termination and refund right applies only to your initial Order of the Cloud Product and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not apply to Additional Services.
You understand that we may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 24 (Changes to these Terms).

11.
Taxes not included.


11.1.
Taxes.
Your fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received.
To the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.

11.2.
Withholding Taxes. You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes.
You and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available.
If we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof.
You will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.

12.
If you purchased through a Reseller.
 If you make any purchases through an authorized partner or reseller of Atlassian (“Reseller”):
(a) Instead of paying us, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller.
We may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Products if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.
(b) Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Products you are entitled to use, the number of End Users, the Subscription Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order as communicated to us.
(c) If you are entitled to a refund under these Terms, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.
(d) Resellers are not authorized to modify these Terms or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in these Terms.

13.
No contingencies on other products of future functionality. You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services.
Payment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order).
You agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.

14.
Evaluations, trials, and betas. We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Atlassian Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, “No-Charge Products”).
Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms).
Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products.
We may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.
You understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, “Beta Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products.
We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.
In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14.
All information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE TERMS, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE US$100.

15.
IP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback. Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as “purchase” or “sale”.
We and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products).
From time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us.
We may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.
No Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

16.
Confidentiality. Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (“Receiving Party”) by the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.
Any of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation.
Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms.
The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 16 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 16.
The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.
(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.
(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.
or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.
The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).
The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.

17.
Term and Termination.


17.1.
Term.
These Terms are effective as of the Effective Date and expire on the date of expiration or termination of all Subscription Terms.

Termination for Convenience. You may choose to stop using the Cloud Products and terminate these Terms (including all Orders) at any time for any reason upon written notice to us, but, unless you are exercising your right to terminate early pursuant to Section 10 (Our return policy), upon any such termination (i) you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if you have not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Subscription Term or related services period (as applicable), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable.

17.4.
Effects of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of these Terms, you must cease using all Cloud Products and delete (or at our request, return) all Confidential Information or other materials of ours in your possession, including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf.
You will certify such deletion upon our request.
You will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of these Terms (or its applicable Subscription Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Products during the applicable Subscription Term.
If you terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.
If we terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), you will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.
In no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

IP Indemnification.
 We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party alleging that the Cloud Products, when used as authorized under these Terms, infringe a patent right granted in the United States, Australia or a member nation of the European Union or a copyright registered in such a jurisdiction (a “Claim”), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded on the Claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to via settlement executed by us (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice).

“Your Materials” means your materials, systems, personnel or other resources.   
1.
Repositories. Data that you upload to Bitbucket Cloud are stored in “repositories.” You designate whether the repositories are public (meaning that anyone coming to the Bitbucket website can view them) or private (meaning that access to those repositories will be limited to those who have permission to access the repositories).
For each public repository that you maintain, you must indicate the license under which you are making the contents of the repository available to others, as well as the license under which you will accept contributions to your repository.

2.
Storage Rules. The Bitbucket Cloud documentation sets forth pre-defined storage limits on Your Data in Bitbucket Cloud.
We enforce those parameters to ensure that you do not use Bitbucket Cloud in a way that consumes a disproportionate amount of system resources (CPU’s, memory, disk space, bandwidth, etc.) or that would adversely impact the performance or operation of Bitbucket Cloud for other Bitbucket Cloud users.
Similarly, since Bitbucket Cloud is designed to be used as a source code repository, we reserve the right to remove any other content (such as music or video), particularly if the content is consuming a disproportionate amount of storage.
Please note that, since we do not maintain access to your repositories, any removal of Your Data under Section 5.5 (Removals and Suspension) of the Agreement means removal of the entire repository in which the offending data resides, not just the offending portions.

3.
Accessing Repositories. If you are accessing code in someone else’s repository, you should carefully read all the licenses applicable to that repository before using or contributing any code.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET CLOUD IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ACCOUNT OWNER CONTROLLING THE PARTICULAR REPOSITORY.
WE ARE NOT THE LICENSOR OF ANY THIRD PARTY CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET CLOUD AND TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH CODE.

4.
Granting Permissions. Be careful about granting permissions to your repositories.
Once you grant such permissions, we will not be able to prevent those users from taking the actions allowed under those permissions, even if you don’t approve of those actions.
Be especially careful about granting administrative access to your repositories, as some of those actions may be irreversible.
For example, if you grant someone permission that allows them to move content in your repository to another account, we will not be able to reach into that other user’s account without their permission to recover the data, as we are not in a position to arbitrate disputes among our users.
In that case, your only recourse may be requesting a takedown under our policy regarding Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations or pursuing legal action against the other user directly.   Privacy Policy

You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.


Atlassian Companies
:  We receive information about you from companies that are owned or operated by Atlassian, in accordance with their terms and policies.


Atlassian Partners
:  We work with a global network of partners who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products.  Some of these partners also help us to market and promote our products, generate leads for us, and resell our products.  We receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Atlassian products you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in. 


Other Partners
: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.    How we use information we collect How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us.  Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.


To provide the Services and personalize your experience
: We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services.  For example, we use the name and picture you provide in your account to identify you to other Service users. Our Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team.  For example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function.  We also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise. We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites. Where you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.   


For research and development
:  We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful to you.  We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services.  For example, to improve the @mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to surface the most relevant connections for users.
We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.  In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use.
We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.  


To communicate with you about the Services
: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.  We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are @mentioned on a page or ticket or when a task if assigned to you. We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.  For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.  We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.  These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them.  If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.   


To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: 
We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google.  These communications are aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.  We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests.  You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under "Opt-out of communications."


Customer support
: We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.


For safety and security
: We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies. 


To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.  


With your consent
: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.  For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.    


Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)
: 
If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.  The legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:

We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;
It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;
You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.
or
We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.


If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g.
your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.  How we share information we collect We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.  This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.  We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below, including in connection with possible business transfers, but we are not in the business of selling information about you to advertisers or other third parties.

Sharing with other Service users 

When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.


For collaboration
: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator (if applicable) select.  Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.  For example, when you comment on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment.  When you send a Stride message to another user, the recipient can view any information in your profile card.
Similarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.  Please be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages or Bitbucket repositories can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted, including information about you, can be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines.  You can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.


Managed accounts and administrators
: If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization’s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.  If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.  


Community Forums
:  Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis like Atlassian Community and Atlassian Developer Community. You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.  Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below.
In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.

Sharing with third parties

We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.


Service Providers
: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.  If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.


Atlassian Partners
: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services.
We may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations.  We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing.


Third Party Apps
: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services.  Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like your name and email address, and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.  If you are a technical or billing contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation. Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information.
We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.


Links to Third Party Sites
: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours.
If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.
We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.


Social Media Widgets
: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours.
Your use of and any information you submit to any of those third-party sites is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. 


Third-Party Widgets
: Some of our Services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter "tweet" button.
These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.
Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.


With your consent
: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.  For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites.
With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial. 


Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.
Enforcement of Our Rights
: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.
For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our Guidelines for Law Enforcement and our Transparency Report.

Sharing with affiliated companies

We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates.  Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us.  The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.


Atlassian companies
: We share information we have about you with other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you. This includes companies that own or operate the services listed here.  


Business Transfers
: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information. How we store and secure information we collect 
Information storage and security

We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store.  For more information on where and how we store your information, please see our Trust page. 
While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian.
We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of data transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.

How long we keep information

How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.  After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.  


Account information
: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.  We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.
Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.  


Information you share on the Services
: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.  For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided. 


Managed accounts
: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.  For more information, see "Managed accounts and administrators" above.


Marketing information
: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.  We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.    How to access and control your information You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information.
Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.

Your Choices: 
You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.  Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.  You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.  For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.
Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.  Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.  If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.


Access and update your information
: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service.
For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service.  You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.


Deactivate your account
:  If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account.
If you can deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings.
Otherwise, please contact your administrator.
If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact Atlassian support.  Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information.
your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Services.  For more information on how to delete your information, see below.   


Delete your information
: Our Services and related documentation give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service.
For example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings.
Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.   


Request that we stop using your information
:  In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.  For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.  Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.
You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.  When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.  If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).  If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.


Opt out of communications
: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.  Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services.
You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings. 
You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.

Tracking Notice.


Send "Do Not Track" Signals
: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.
Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.


Data portability
: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).  Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.  Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces you under your sole control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.   How we transfer information we collect internationally

Notice to End Users

Many of our products are intended for use by organizations.
Where the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g.
your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Services and is responsible for the accounts and/or Service sites over which it has control.
If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Services is subject to that organization's policies.
We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy. 
Administrators are able to:

require you to reset your account password;
restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
access information in and about your account;
access or retain information stored as part of your account;
install or uninstall third-party apps or other integrations 


In some cases, administrators can also:

restrict, suspend or terminate your account access;
change the email address associated with your account;
change your information, including profile information;
restrict your ability to edit, restrict, modify or delete information


Even if the Services are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Services, then the owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g.
your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Services at a later date.  You will be notified if this happens. 
If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Services, use your personal email address to register for or access the Services.  If an administrator has not already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your profile.  Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Services, you will no longer be able to change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.
Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator’s organizational policies for more information.

Our policy towards children

The Services are not directed to individuals under 16.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.
If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact our support services.

Changes to our Privacy Policy

We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice by adding a notice on the Services homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification.
We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.  We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
If you disagree with any changes to this privacy policy, you will need to stop using the Services and deactivate your account(s), as outlined above.
