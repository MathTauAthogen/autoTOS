 Blend Swap is a big site, and nowadays it is rather hard to keep track of everything happening in comments and messages across the community.
This is the Code of Conduct we expect you to uphold for the good of the community and your account.
Failure to comply with these simple rules will result in your account getting audited and even closed permanently.


Be respectful to your peers:
All users on Blend Swap are equal, regardless of their gender, nationality, religion (or lack thereof), sexual orientation, age, level of expertise with Blender, etc.
Report any harrassment directed towards you or any other users.
Be solidary and all around awesome with everybody.

Be strictly respectful of other artists copyright:
DON'T EVER UPLOAD MATERIAL BY ANOTHER ARTIST THAT YOU GOT FROM ANOTHER SITE THAT'S NOT PROPERLY LICENSED UNDER A BLEND-SWAP-COMPATIBLE CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE.
Ripping, plagiarism and impersonation will not be tolerated.
Users found abusing someone else's art or identity will be blocked permanently without a warning of any kind.
No second chances.

Leave good, helpful comments:
Thank the blend authors any time! That's a gesture everybody appreciates.
Criticism is good, but try your best to be polite when criticizing some one else's work.
artists have put time and effort in their blends and they share them with love and passion, don't ruin the party by being a dick.
If you don't like a model, that's ok, but if you can't give advice for improvements, it's better if you don't say anything and move on.

Don't feed the trolls:
From time to time a troll will appear on the site, being a total douche and flaming the comment threads.
Don't fall to their level and leave similar responses.
Report trolls to us the admins ( @poifox , @mofx ) and we'll get rid of them.
If you start answering with profanity to a troll we might as well block you too.

Be respectful to the admins:
We are people, we don't like being told that our service just plain sucks without a good reason, you're not going to get anywhere if you flame our email inbox.
We are very cool guys if you're cool to us.
We will do our best to get the site working for you as fast as we can, but if you are a dick to us you're just getting yourself in trouble.

Report anything that's not working as expected, spam comments, trolls, site errors, you guys are our eyes out there, the site is really big now and we don't have enough time with our day jobs to take care of every little error.
We will normally solve the problems within minutes of your report (unless we're sleeping or it's a weekend).

Read the site's documentation and Terms of Use:
We've spent a lot of time writing these pages, so you can get most answers from them.
If your question is still not answered write us from the Contact form, with you input, questions and feedback are always welcome.

Enjoy the site.


Thanks.

 Last updated on June 03, 2014, @ 12:58 pm (America/Chicago)    Blend Swap uses theCreative Commons license system.
We've decided to use three licenses for all the models on Blend Swap.
We've done this to keep licensing as simple as we can on the site while still offering authors a variety of ways to distribute and protect their art.
The following is a short enumeration of how every License applies:

 Creative Commons Zero Mark (CC-0) This license lets creators and owners of copyright-protected content to waive all copyright interests in their works and thereby place them as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without restrictions under copyright.
You should be aware that by choosing this license you are granting the entire world (where applicable by law) to use your work for any purpose, even without the requirement to credit you.
Be careful with this license because once you marked a blend as CC-Zero it's out of your hands, forever.
Read more about the CC0 Mark

 Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation.
This is the most accommodating of licenses offered, in terms of what others can do with your works licensed under Attribution.
This license grants everybody in the world (where applicable by law) permission to use a blend for any purpose, even commercial, but under an Attribution requirement, that is, the original author asks to be credited for the blend in the derivative works of the work users.
If a user of the blend will not credit the original author the user has no permission to use the blend.
 View License Deed |View Legal Code

 Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.
This license is often compared to open source software licenses.
All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.
This license grants everybody in the world (where applicable by law) permission to use the blend for any purpose, even commercial, as long as they credit the original author of the blend and redistribute their derivative works under the same license.
If you use a CC-BY-SA licensed blend, you MUST credit the original author of the blend and your derivative work__MUST__ be released under the same CC-BY-SA license to the rest of the world.
View License Deed |View Legal Code

 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.
If you use a CC-BY-SA licensed blend, you MUST credit the original author of the blend and your derivative work MUST be released under the same CC-BY-SA license to the rest of the world.
Additionaly, you MUST NOT use the work for commercial purposes unless you get express consent from the original author.
View License Deed |View Legal Code What does Creative Commons mean to Blend Swap? Creative Commons enables Blend Swap to operate under the premise of providing free/libre blends to the world, and enables our community and features to keep growing under the rights granted to all of us by the authors who share their work on the site, enabling us to serve their works to the world and them to get exposure in the Blender community. How should I use the works hosted on Blend Swap? All blends hosted on Blend Swap are usable for any purpose, even commercial,except CC-BY-NC-SAÂ as long as you respect the license the blend is under.
Blends under CC-0 (Creative Commons Zero) license can be used without ever asking for permission, for any purpose, even commercially.
You areÂ advisedÂ to give attribution but you are not required to do so.
Blends under CC-BY (CreativeCommons-Attribution) license can be used for any purpose, even commercially, but you have the__obligation__ to credit the author.
If you can't credit the author, for example, because you are using the blend in a TV spot, where credits don't exist, you MUST message the author of the blend to ask for a license exclusion, but it's up to the author of the blend to give this permission.
Blend Swap will not intermediate in these transactions.
If the author refuses to give theÂ exemptionÂ permission you will not use the blend.
The rule above applies also for blends under CC-BY-SA (CreativeCommons-Attribution-ShareAlike) license and its extra SA clause.
You can message the author asking for exclusion of either of the clauses or both, but it's up to them to give the permission.
Keep in mind ourTerms Of Use. How do I credit the author(s)? When using the blend in a film production, include the author in your credits roll.
If in a rendered still image, include a text file with the downloadable image file, or add their credit to the image description meta data.
If you are uploading a new updated version of the blend to Blend Swap, please include a link to the original blend in your blend description in this format:

This blend uses Name of the Blend by Author Name , originally released under ORIGINALLICENSE


You are advised to keep the license the same as the original, but you can "upgrade" them in these two ways
CC-0 â�� CC-BY or CC-BY-SA
CC-BY â�� CC-BY-SA
No other license change is allowed.
Have you seen a suspicious blend?Let us know â�� Fan Art: Blend Swap is open for everybody to upload their 3D models and related files.
We have insisted time and time again that you should only upload your own work, made by you from the ground up, that is: your design, your meshes, your textures.
However we're conscious that many fans of TV shows, movies, games, and manufactured products love to use the site to share their recreations of famous designs and ideas originally created by third party companies.
These works fall under the special categorization of Fan Art, that is, a model or piece of 2D/3D art that depicts a design, logo, product or character originally conceived by a third party artist or company not related to the blend author or Blend Swap.
All Blend Swap users must know one very important thing, FAN ART IS NOT FAIR USE OF THIRD PARTY DESIGNS AND IDEAS, as described in the english Wikipedia entry:

The legal status of fan made art in America may be tricky due to the vagaries of the United States Copyright Act.
Generally, the right to reproduce and display pieces of artwork is controlled by the original author or artist under 17 U.S.C.
Â§ 106.
However, fan art using settings and characters from a previously created work could be considered a derivative work, which would place control of the copyright with the owner of that original work.
Display and distribution of fan art that would be considered a derivative work would be unlawful.
However, American copyright law allows for the production, display and distribution of derivative works if they fall under a fair use exemption, 17 U.S.C.
Â§ 107.
A court would look at all relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether a particular use qualifies as fair use.
a multi-pronged rubric for this decision involves evaluating the amount and substantiality of the original appropriated, the transformative nature of the derivative work, whether the derivative work was done for educational or noncommercial use, and the economic effect that the derivative work imposes on the copyright holder's ability to make and exploit their own derivative works.
None of these factors is alone dispositive.
American courts also typically grant broad protection to parody, and some fan art may fall into this category.
This has not explicitly been adjudicated with respect to fan art, however.
Moreover, while parody is typically afforded protection under Â§ 107, a court must engage in a fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry for each work.

This means that we have to exclude your Fan Art from commercial use for it to be eligible for Fair Use exemption, this, however does not warrant any type of Fair Use exclusion under US Law (and other parts of the world), so the copyright holder can still initiate a lawsuit for copyright infringement.
This is why we implemented the Fan Art mark on the site, to let people know, that regardless of the license attached to the file,Â nooneÂ should EVER use the Fan Art marked works for commercial purposes.
Using copyrighted designs for commercial purposes without the consent of the copyright holder is against the law in the US and most parts of the world, and According to our Terms of Use, which you accept by just using the site, any copyright infringement is your sole liability and Blend Swap is exempt from your use of the site and the files you upload.
We must ask you to please mark your blends depicting any character, design, product, logo etc, made by a third party unrelated to you as Fan Art so everybody on the site knows about the restrictions actually ruling your file, regardless of the CC License attached to it.
Blend Swap will stop serving or completely remove files reported for copyright infringement by another user that presents evidence of the authorship problem or if we receive a Cease and Desist request from a big company.
As the copyright holders Companies have all their right to request complete removal of files featuring their designs.
If you represent a company that has detected unlawful use of your company's design please send a Cease and Desist note to:

Blend Swap, LLC
3208 E 17th St.
Sioux Falls, SD 57103

with the following information:

Names of the products/characters/etc
Links of the offending models

and your request to pull the offending content offline. Note: If the third party design is a CC licensed in an Open Source fashion, like the Open Movie projects from the Blender Institute, or the design was released under CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-Zero, by the original author, you don't have to mark your blend as fan art, because this type of original material is Open Source and as such, you only have to respect the original license.
For more information on how CC licenses apply, please read our licensing page. Remember: According to our Terms of Use: By using the Site and it's services and features you accept the Terms of Use, which clearly state all the content you submit or upload to the site is your soleÂ responsibilityÂ  including, but not limited to, files, comments, feedback entries, messages, contact submissions, etc.
Ultimately, you are responsible for copyright infringement and you have acknowledged that in no instance shall Blend Swap be held responsible for the content you submit to the website. Furthermore: We do not tolerate plagiarism, ripping or impersonation.
Any user found to be performing any of these faults, according to our Terms of Use, will be immediately and permanently blocked, if not banned.
3D art is a very valuable asset and blatant plagiarism really does nothing good for your reputation.
If you steal from another artist, sooner or later, we will know.

If you copy something, followed a tutorial, or revamped an Open Source model/file, please say so.
There's no shame in copying or modifying but there is in stealing.
