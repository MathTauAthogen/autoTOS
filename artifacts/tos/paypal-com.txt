  PayPal Receive Funds and Automatic Transfer Agreement &nbsp.
&gt;&gt.
View all legal agreements PayPal Receive Funds and Automatic Transfer Agreement Last Update: October 8, 2014 Print &nbsp;
This policy applies to users in the following countries: Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dominica, Egypt, Fiji, French Polynesia, Grenada, Lesotho, Malawi, New Caledonia, Palau, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos.
This PayPal Receive Funds and Automatic Transfer Agreement ("Agreement") is a contract between you and PayPal.
This Agreement applies to you in addition to the User Agreement and other applicable agreements.
All capitalized terms shall have the definitions provided in this Agreement, or if a definition is not provided in this Agreement, the definition in the User Agreement shall apply.
You must read, agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.
We may amend this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version on our website.
The revised version will be effective at the time we post it.
In addition, if the revised version includes a Substantial Change, we will provide you with 30 Days' prior notice of Substantial Change by posting notice on the "Policy Updates" page of our website.
PayPal Receive Funds and Automatic Transfer allows you to receive payments into your PayPal account and have those amounts automatically transferred to your linked US bank account or Visa credit card.
All payments that you receive are subject to a 30-day hold period.
Please read these terms and conditions to understand PayPal’s requirements for receiving payments.
&nbsp; 1.
Eligibility: 
In order to receive payments into your PayPal account, you must link your US bank account or Visa credit card to your PayPal account and complete PayPal’s credit card and/or bank account verification process.

&nbsp; 2.
Automatic Transfer: 
On a regular basis, PayPal will automatically transfer the amounts from your available PayPal Balance to your US bank account or Visa credit card.
The automatic transfer will occur within the first 3 days of each month, quarter, or applicable period in the country in which you reside.
There is no fee for automatic transfers to your US bank account or Visa credit card.

&nbsp; 3.
Manual Transfer and Fee: 
If you do not want to wait for the automatic transfer, you may manually transfer the amounts in your available PayPal balance to your US bank account or Visa credit card.

Manual transfers to your Visa credit card will incur a $5.00 USD (or equivalent) fee.
Manual transfers to your US bank account are free.



&nbsp; 4.
Payment Hold Period: 
All payments that you receive will be subject to an initial 30 day hold period and will be placed in a pending balance.
This means that you will not have access to your funds for at least 30 days.
After the initial 30 day hold period, your funds will be released to your available balance unless PayPal is holding the amounts for another reason as specified in the PayPal User Agreement, or other agreement that you have entered into with PayPal.
PayPal, in its sole discretion, may determine that you are no longer subject to an initial 30 day hold period.
In such an event, payments you receive into your PayPal account will appear in your available balance soon after you receive the payment.
PayPal will base its decision to remove the 30 day hold period on a number of factors including but not limited to the following: the length of time you have been a PayPal customer, the type of goods or services that you sell, and the number of customer complaints that you receive.

&nbsp; 5.
Withdrawal Limits: 
Automatic transfers to your Visa credit card are limited to $10,000 USD (or equivalent) per transfer.
Manual transfers to a Visa credit card are limited to $500 USD (or equivalent) per day.
The daily limit of transfers to your Visa credit card (total of automatic and manual transfers) is $10,000 USD (or equivalent).

&nbsp; 6.
Financial Instruments (linked US bank account or Visa credit card): 
If you have more than one financial instrument linked to your PayPal account, PayPal will use the first financial instrument that you linked to your PayPal account for automatic transfers.

This means that if you link a Visa credit card to your PayPal account one day, and then link a second Visa credit card to your account the next day, PayPal will use the first Visa credit card for the automatic transfer.
You may change this by going to the “Profile” page, selecting “Manage Automatic Transfer”, and following the instructions to select your preferred financial instrument for automatic transfers.


If you remove your US bank account and/or Visa credit card, PayPal will request that you add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.
If you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.
If PayPal is unable to transfer your balance to your US bank account and/or Visa credit card for any reason, then PayPal will give you a limited amount of time to add a new financial instrument to your PayPal account.
If you do not do so, you will lose the ability to receive payments.

&nbsp; 7.
Restriction on Sending Payments: 
You may use your credit card to send payments.
You may not use your PayPal balance or US bank account to send payments.
All amounts in your available PayPal balance must be withdrawn from your PayPal account through automatic and/or manual transfer.

   eBay Billing Agreement &gt;&gt.
View all legal agreements Ebay Billing Agreement 
Last Update: Mar 08, 2007 Print &nbsp;


PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
This eBay Billing Agreement ("Billing Agreement") is between PayPal, Inc., PayPal CA Limited, and PayPal Pte.
Ltd.
(collectively "PayPal"), eBay Inc.
("eBay") and you.
&nbsp;


AUTHORIZATION TO CHARGE YOUR PAYPAL ACCOUNT FOR EBAY FEES
By agreeing to these terms, you are giving eBay permission to charge your PayPal account on a one-time, sporadic, or recurring basis to collect fees that you owe eBay, unless and until you cancel your Billing Agreement.
You authorize PayPal to pay from your PayPal account the full amount of fees presented by eBay.
PayPal will not initiate payments on its own under this Billing Agreement.
it will only pay out charges initiated by eBay.
eBay will present you with an invoice at least 10 days in advance of charging your PayPal account.
PayPal will become your payment method on file with eBay for automatic payment of your eBay selling fees.
If you previously had another payment method on file for automatic payment of fees, PayPal will replace that method.
If you change the website of registration of your eBay account (for example, you change registration from eBay.com to eBay.ca), this Billing Agreement will be cancelled.
If you change the currency of your eBay account, you will need to again specify PayPal as your automatic payment method for your account in the new currency.
If this Billing Agreement is cancelled, or if the payment of your eBay fees through PayPal cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay eBay for all unpaid fees, and eBay may charge a payment method previously on file with eBay for payment of your selling fees, such as a credit card or checking account.
&nbsp;


FUNDING SOURCE USE
When eBay charges your PayPal account, PayPal will always attempt to withdraw funds from your PayPal balance first.
If funds in your balance are insufficient, PayPal will look for and attempt to charge a Preferred Funding Source that you have set up for this Billing Agreement.
If the Preferred Funding Source fails (for example, a credit card expires), then PayPal will use other available funding sources within your PayPal account.
You will have the ability to disable funding sources for use with this Billing Agreement, with the exception that if you have one or more credit or debit cards linked to your PayPal account, then at least one of those cards must be enabled for billing.
You will be able to select or deselect a Preferred Funding Source, and to enable or disable other funding sources, both within the enrollment flow, and at any time through the Direct Payments link under the Account Profile tab when you log in to the PayPal website.

   COMMERCIAL ENTITY AGREEMENT FOR PAYPAL PAYMENT CARD FUNDED PROCESSING SERVICES &nbsp.
This Commercial Entity Agreement for PayPal Payment Card Funded Processing Services (“Commercial Entity Agreement” or "CEA") is agreed with all PayPal Users that are Commercial Entities (as defined by Visa Europe, Visa Inc, Visa International, Mastercard Worldwide, UK Maestro, Solo and/or International Maestro (together the "Associations")).
Each such PayPal User is referred to as “Merchant” and may be referred to herein as “you” and/or “your”.
This CEA constitutes your separate legally binding contract for credit and debit card processing for PayPal transactions between you and the Acquirer (as defined below).
For the purposes of this CEA, "Acquirer" shall mean (a) Worldpay (UK) Limited if Merchant is based in Europe.
and/or (b) Worldpay PTE Ltd if Merchant is based in Singapore.
and/or (c) Worldpay (HK) Limited if Merchant is based in Hong Kong.
and/or (d) Citizens Bank, N.A.
if Merchant is based in the United States and/or (d) Worldpay PTY.
Ltd if Merchant is based in Australia.
In this CEA "we", "us" and "our" refer to Acquirer.
In accordance with the provisions of this CEA, Acquirer may terminate its provision of credit and debit card processing services and require PayPal to enforce any of the provisions of Merchant’s agreement(s) with PayPal ("PayPal Agreement"), agreed by and between Merchant and PayPal.
Merchant agrees to the terms and conditions of this CEA.
Merchant further agrees that this CEA forms a legally binding contract between Merchant and Acquirer.
PayPal is not a party to this contract and acts only as Acquirer’s agent in connection with it.
If we propose to change this CEA in a substantial manner, PayPal will provide you on our behalf with at least 30 days' (or such minimum period as is required by law) prior notice of such a change.
After the notice period elapses, you will be deemed to have agreed to all such amendments to the CEA.
To amend this CEA but not in a substantial manner, PayPal will post on our behalf a revised version of the CEA on the PayPal website(s), and the revised version will be effective at the time PayPal posts it.
&nbsp;If you disagree with any proposed amendments, you may close your PayPal account before the expiry of the notice &nbsp;period provided in the notice and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the PayPal Agreement, and this CEA will terminate on the closure of your account.
A change to this CEA will be considered to be made in a “substantial manner” if the change involves a reduction to your rights or increases your responsibilities.


Purpose of this CEA. When your customers pay you through PayPal, they have the option of paying you through a funding source supported by PayPal including a card.
In most instances, you will not know the funding source that your customer selected.
Since you may be the recipient of a card funded payment, the Associations require that you enter into a direct contractual relationship with an acquirer who is a member of the Associations.
By entering into this CEA, you are fulfilling such Association requirement and you are agreeing to comply with Association rules as they pertain to payments you receive through the PayPal service.

Obligations of Acquirer.&nbsp.


Acquirer’s obligations under this CEA are limited exclusively to the processing of Merchant's card transactions in the territory in which the Merchant is based and the receipt and disbursement of related funds to PayPal for the account of the Merchant (the “Acquiring Services”).&nbsp.
All other obligations relating to the provision of the services under the PayPal Agreement are the responsibility of PayPal and any issue, dissatisfaction, dispute and/or service dispute of the Merchant relating to any services provided to the Merchant should be notified to and brought against PayPal in the first instance.
Subject to the terms of this CEA and the PayPal Agreement, Acquirer will initiate a payment to the designated account (as made known to Acquirer by PayPal) of an amount equal to the value of card transactions processed by Acquirer for the Merchant under this CEA (less deductions for refunds, fines, assessments, chargebacks, chargeback costs, fees or other Merchant liabilities (whether actual or anticipated) under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement).
&nbsp;Any obligation of Acquirer to remit funds under this CEA is subject to any rights of Acquirer under its agreement with PayPal.
Merchant agrees that any payment made to PayPal by Acquirer under this CEA will be deemed good receipt by Merchant of the sums due from Acquirer to Merchant in relation to Acquirer’s liability to Merchant under this CEA.
Merchant shall indemnify Acquirer and keep Acquirer indemnified against all losses, costs, claims, demands, expenses (including legal expenses) and liabilities of any nature (including any re-settlement obligations under the Association rules) arising from or relating to the payment of funds by Acquirer into an account in the name of PayPal in accordance with the terms of this CEA.
Throughout the term of this CEA and after its termination for any reason, Acquirer shall be entitled to defer (for such period as it shall in its reasonable discretion consider appropriate) the date upon which the payment of funds in respect of card transactions would (but for this clause) be due in order to protect its position with respect to actual or anticipated chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees, fraud, illegal activity or any other liability of Merchant or relating to any card transactions or under this CEA or the PPA, whether actual or anticipated.&nbsp.
Amounts so deferred may be set-off against any actual chargebacks, fines, assessments, refunds, chargeback costs, fees or any other liability of Merchant.&nbsp;&nbsp.
The Merchant understands and acknowledges that during the term of this CEA and after its termination for any reason whatsoever, the Merchant shall continue to bear total responsibility for all chargebacks, chargeback costs, refunds, fines, assessments, fees, fraud and illegal activity resulting in any way from card transactions processed pursuant to this CEA and all other amounts then due or which thereafter may become due under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement.



Association Rules.


Deposit Transactions. Merchant agrees that it shall only accept payments through PayPal processing services for bona fide transactions between the Merchant and its customer for the sale of goods or services.
Merchant shall not submit a transaction for the refinance or transfer of an existing obligation that was uncollectible.
Merchant acknowledges that for Visa and Mastercard payments, PayPal shall obtain an authorization for transaction amounts prior to completing the transaction.

Split Transactions. Merchant agrees not to split the sale into two (or more) separate amounts in order to avoid obtaining authorization for the full amount.
Except, however in an instance where the Merchant and cardholder agree on a partial shipment of product, or where the transaction qualifies for delayed delivery or special order deposits (such as partial shipments based on inventory on hand), a sale may be split into multiple transactions.

Minimum or Maximum/Surcharges. Merchant agrees that it shall not set minimum or maximum transaction amounts or impose surcharges as a condition of honoring Visa and Mastercard cards, unless otherwise permitted in the particular jurisdiction of a transaction.

Visa and Mastercard Marks. Merchant is authorized to and must use the Visa and Mastercard logos or marks on Merchant’s promotional materials and website to indicate that Visa and Mastercard cards are accepted as funding sources for PayPal transactions.

Discrimination. Merchant agrees that it shall not engage in any acceptance practice that discriminates against or discourages the use of Visa or Mastercard in favour of any other card brand unless otherwise permitted in the particular jurisdiction of a transaction.

Access to Cardholder Data. Merchant acknowledges that where it has access to Cardholder Data (defined as the cardholder’s card number, expiration date, and CVV2) it will abide by any data security standards of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (or any replacement body), Visa or Mastercard, including the Payment Card Industry SSC Standards.
In addition you agree to comply with the data security standards required by PayPal under the PayPal Agreement, as may be amended from time to time.&nbsp.
.
In the event that Merchant receives Cardholder Data in connection with the PayPal processing services, Merchant agrees that it will not use the Cardholder Data for any purpose that it knows or should know to be fraudulent or in violation of any Association rules.
Merchant also agrees that it will not sell, purchase, provide or exchange in any manner or disclose Cardholder Data to anyone other than its acquirer, Visa or Mastercard (as applicable) or in response to a government request.

Merchant Identification. Merchant agrees to prominently and unequivocally inform the cardholder of the identity of the Merchant at all points of interaction including the location (physical address) of the Merchant to enable the cardholder to easily determine whether the transaction will be a domestic transaction or a cross-border transaction.

Chargebacks. Merchant shall use all reasonable methods to resolve disputes with the cardholder.
Should a chargeback dispute occur, Merchant shall promptly comply with all requests for information from PayPal.
Merchant shall not attempt to recharge a cardholder for an item that has been charged back to the cardholder, unless the cardholder has authorized such actions.



Merchant’s Refund Policy must be on Merchant’s Website. If Merchant limits refund/exchange terms or other specific conditions for Card sales, Merchant’s policy must be clearly provided to the cardholder prior to the sale and Merchant must conform with all applicable laws and the Association rules.

Audit.&nbsp.
Upon Acquirer’s request, the Merchant must promptly disclose to Acquirer such information as Acquirer reasonably requires in order to enable Acquirer to perform its obligations, and/or assess its financial and insurance risks in connection with the services provided, and/or to assess the Merchant’s compliance with the terms of the CEA and/or the Association rules.

Term and Termination. This CEA is effective upon the date the PayPal Agreement between Merchant and PayPal comes into force and continues so long as the PayPal Agreement remains in force between Merchant and PayPal but shall automatically terminate without notice on termination of such PayPal Agreement for any reason, provided that those terms which by their nature are intended to survive termination (including without limitation, indemnification obligations and limitations of liability) shall survive.
This CEA may be terminated by Acquirer at any time in the event of a breach of any of Merchant’s obligations under this CEA or the PayPal Agreement, or by Merchant in the event of a breach of any of Acquirer’s obligations under this CEA, or by Acquirer in the event of the termination of the acquiring services agreement entered into between PayPal (or its applicable group company) and Acquirer as notified to the Merchant.

Indemnification. Merchant agrees to indemnify and hold Acquirer harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages and expense: (a) resulting from any breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement or any misrepresentation by Merchant under this CEA.
(b) arising out of Merchant’s or its employees’ negligence or willful misconduct, (c) arising in connection with Card transactions or otherwise arising from Merchant’s provision of goods and services to Cardholders or customers.
(d) arising out of Merchant’s use of the PayPal Service.
or (e) resulting from any fines or arising out of any third party indemnifications&nbsp;Acquirer is obligated to make as a result of Merchant’s actions (including indemnification of any Association or Card issuing bank).

Assignment/Amendments. This CEA may not be assigned by Merchant without the prior written consent of Acquirer.
Acquirer may assign its rights under this CEA without Merchant’s consent.

Warranty Disclaimer. This CEA is a service agreement.
Acquirer disclaims all representations or warranties, express or implied, made to Merchant or any other person, including without limitation, any warranties regarding quality, suitability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or otherwise of any services or any goods provided incidental to the services provided under this CEA to the extent permitted by law.

Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding anything in this CEA to the contrary, in no event shall Acquirer, or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or subcontractors, be liable under any theory of tort, contract, strict liability or other legal theory for lost profits, lost revenues, lost business opportunities, exemplary, punitive, special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages, each of which is hereby excluded by agreement of the parties, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable or whether Acquirer has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Notwithstanding anything in this CEA to the contrary, in no event shall Acquirer be liable or responsible for any delays or errors in its performance of the services caused by its service providers or other parties or events outside of Acquirer’s reasonable control, including PayPal.
Notwithstanding anything in this CEA to the contrary, Acquirer’s cumulative liability for all losses, claims, suits, controversies, breaches or damages for any cause whatsoever arising out of or related to this CEA and regardless of the form of action or legal theory and whether or not arising in contract or tort (including negligence) shall not exceed the total volume of all transactions, expressed as a U.S.
dollar amount processed by the Merchant under this CEA via PayPal.
Nothing in this CEA shall exclude or limit any liability of any party for death or personal injury caused by negligence or fraud, deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation, howsoever caused.

Waiver. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this CEA, including, but not limited to, the right to terminate this CEA in the event of breach or default by the other party, will not be deemed to constitute a waiver by that party of its right to enforce each and every provision of this CEA in accordance with its terms.

Relationship between the Parties. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment relationship is created between Merchant and Acquirer by way of this CEA.
In the performance of their respective obligations hereunder, the parties are, and will be, independent contractors.
Nothing in this CEA will be construed to constitute either party as the agent for the other for any purpose whatsoever.

No Illegal Use of Services. Merchant will not access and/or utilize the Acquiring Services for illegal purposes and will not interfere or disrupt networks connected with the Acquiring Services.

Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this CEA will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision hereof will be prohibited by or determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this CEA.

Governing Law. This CEA (and the relationships referred to or contemplated by it) shall be governed and construed in accordance with English law and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales with respect to any dispute hereunder.

When you integrate our LPM functionality into your online checkout, we may (but are not obliged to) allow anybody to use an LPM to pay you.&nbsp;
Annex 1 of these Terms list each LPM which we may make available to your customers from time to time and further provisions relating to your receipt of payments from customers using that LPM.&nbsp;You must comply with those provisions at all times.
&nbsp;
As the payer does not use a PayPal Account to send an LPM payment, you may not use PayPal to proactively refund LPM payments, unless otherwise stated in Annex 1 of these Terms.
You may not receive LPM payments in currencies other than those stated for the given LPM in Annex 1 of these Terms.
You may use our LPM functionality only with a Business Account and not a Personal Account.

4.
Your liability to us

We may treat the LPM providers and the payment processors which help us to enable you to receive LPM payments in the same way as we treat our bank/card acquirers and/or other payment processors under the User Agreement.

LPM payments are at risk of reversals by the LPM provider unless otherwise stated in Annex 1.
Your obligations and liability towards us for these reversals are the same as those you have towards us for Reversals and/or Chargebacks under the User Agreement.&nbsp;The LPM provider may influence the reversal of an LPM payment in the same way as the payer’s bank may infsluence a Reversal and/or the payer’s card company may influence a Chargeback.
After termination of these Terms you will continue to be liable towards us under these Terms for reversals of LPM payments by the LPM providers and all your outstanding obligations arising from your use of the LPM functionality prior to termination.

5.
Changes and termination

We may add to or remove from the list of LPMs/LPM providers in Annex 1 of these Terms at any time and without notice.&nbsp;
Otherwise, we may amend, delete or add to these Terms in line with the change process set out in the User Agreement.&nbsp;If you do not agree with any change, you may terminate these Terms.
You may terminate these Terms at any time by removing our LPM functionality from your online checkout and following any other integration-related steps which PayPal may make available to you from time to time.&nbsp;This enables you stop allowing your customers to use an LPM to pay you, but otherwise your Account remains open and the User Agreement remains in effect.&nbsp;
We may, at any time, for any reason and (where possible) with reasonable prior notice, terminate, cancel or suspend the Service to the extent it relates to our LPM functionality and/or LPMs without liability towards you.
These Terms survive any termination to the extent and for so long as we are required to: (i) deal with matters arising from your use of the LPM functionality prior to termination.
and/or (ii) comply with applicable laws and regulations.

A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform.
&nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp.
When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp.
Examples of account connections include:

linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;
connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials.
or
using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.

If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp.
For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp.
If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.
&nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;
Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp.
Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp.
For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;How Do We Use Cookies and Tracking Technologies?&nbsp.
When you visit our Sites, use our Services, or visit a third-party website for which we provide online Services, we and our business partners and vendors may use cookies and other tracking technologies (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a User and to customize your online experiences, the Services you use, and other online content and advertising.

 PayPal may limit the number of Digital Goods refunds that you may receive.
If these are limited or if your purchase is not eligible for coverage, you will still be able to follow PayPal’s standard dispute resolution processes described in this Section 7 to attempt to resolve the issue with the Seller directly.

7.7 Relationship between PayPal's protection programs and Chargebacks.&nbsp;Credit card Chargeback rights, if they apply, may be broader than PayPal’s protection programs.
Chargebacks may cover unsatisfactory items even if they do not qualify as SNAD.
You may pursue a Dispute/Claim with PayPal, or you may contact your credit card company and pursue your Chargeback rights.
You may not pursue both at the same time or seek a double recovery.
If you have an open Dispute or Claim with PayPal, and also file a Chargeback with your credit card company, PayPal will close your Dispute or Claim, and you will have to rely solely on your Chargeback rights.
Before contacting your card issuer or filing a Dispute with PayPal, you should contact the Seller to resolve your issue in accordance with the Seller’s return policy as stated on their auction or website.

7.8 Claims filed with Seller or other third parties.&nbsp;You may not file a Dispute/Claim under PayPal Buyer Protection if you have already filed a claim with the Seller or another third party (other than eBay).

7.9 No Double Recovery.&nbsp;You may not receive a recovery for a purchase under PayPal Buyer Protection if you have already received a recovery for that purchase directly from the Seller or another third party.

&nbsp; 8.
Errors and Unauthorized Transactions.

8.1 Protection for Unauthorized Transactions and Errors.&nbsp;When an Unauthorized Transaction or an Error occurs in your Account, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of every eligible Unauthorized Transaction or Error so long as you follow the procedures discussed below.
An Unauthorized Transaction occurs when a payment is sent from your Account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.
For example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your Account, and sends a payment from your Account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.
If you give someone access to your Account (by giving them your login information) and they conduct transactions without your knowledge or permission, you are responsible for any resulting use.

8.2 Notification Requirements.

a.
You should immediately notify PayPal if you believe:

there has been an Unauthorized Transaction or unauthorized access to your Account;
there is an Error in your Account history statement (you can access your Account history statement by logging into your Account and clicking on a link to “View all of my transactions” ) or in your transaction confirmation sent to you by email;
your password or PayPal Mobile PIN has been compromised;
your PayPal Mobile-activated phone has been lost, stolen or deactivated.
or
you need more information about a transaction listed on the statement or transaction confirmation.

b.
To be eligible for protection for Unauthorized Transactions, you must notify us within 60 Days after any Unauthorized Transaction first appears in your Account history statement.
We will extend the 60 Day time period if a good and demonstrable reason, such as a hospital stay, kept you from notifying us within 60 Days.
 You should regularly log into your Account and review your Account history statement to ensure that there has not been an Unauthorized Transaction or Error.
PayPal will also send an email to the primary email address you have provided in order to notify you of each transaction from your Account.
You should also review these transaction confirmations to ensure that each transaction was authorized and is accurate.
For Unauthorized Transactions or Errors in your Account, notify us as follows:


Use this form&nbsp;to file a report in the PayPal Resolution Center.
or
Write to PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O.
Box 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950.
or
Call PayPal Customer Service at (402) 935-7733 (in the U.S.).

When you notify us, provide us with all of the following information:

Your name and email address registered to your Account;
A description of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error and an explanation as to why you believe it is incorrect or why you need more information to identify the transaction.
and
The amount of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error.

If you notify us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days.
During the course of our investigation, we may request additional information from you.

8.3 PayPal Actions after Receipt of Your Notification.&nbsp;Once you notify us of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error, or we otherwise learn of one, we will do the following:

We will conduct an investigation to determine whether there has been an Unauthorized Transaction or Error that is eligible for protection.
We will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days of the date we received your notification of the suspected Unauthorized Transactions or Error.
If your Account is new (the first transaction from your Account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete this investigation.
If we need more time, we may take up to 45 Days to complete our investigation (or up to 90 Days for new Accounts, or if your transaction was at a point of sale where you were physically present, or a foreign initiated transaction).
If we decide that we need more time to complete our investigation, we will provisionally credit your Account for the amount of the suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error.
You will receive the provisional credit within 10 Business Days of the date we received your notice (or 20 Business Days for new Accounts).
This will allow you to have use of the money until we complete the investigation.
We will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting.
If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days (or 20 Business Days for new Accounts), we will not provisionally credit your Account.
We will inform you of our decision within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.

If we determine that there was an Unauthorized Transaction or Error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your Account within 1 Business Day of our determination.
Or, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.
 If we decide that there was not an Unauthorized Transaction or Error, we will include an explanation of our decision in our email to you.
If you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your Account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit.
You may request copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

8.4 PayPal Errors.&nbsp;We will rectify any Error that we discover.
If the Error results in your receipt of less than the correct amount to which you are entitled, PayPal will credit your Account for the difference.
If the Error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you are entitled, PayPal will debit the extra funds from your Account.

8.5 Your Errors.&nbsp;If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example), your only recourse will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment.
PayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.

 "Signature Confirmation" is online documentation that can be viewed at the shipping company's website and indicates that the item was signed for on delivery.
“Proof of Delivery (for intangible or virtual items or services)” means any compelling evidence to show the purchase order was fulfilled and includes all of the following:
a.
The date the item or service was provided;
b.
The recipient’s address (email/IP, etc) where applicable.
NOTE: Although Buyer Protection extends coverage to buyers for intangible items, Seller Protection does not apply to intangible items.

 The following are examples of items/transactions not eligible for PayPal Seller Protection:

Claims or Chargebacks for Significantly Not as Described.
Items that you deliver in person, including at a point of sale.

Mass Payment / Payouts.
Counterfeit goods.
Items that are not shipped to the recipient address.
If you originally ship the item to the recipient address but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection.
We therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.
Donations.
Financial products and investments.

Your Liability - Actions We May Take.

11.1 Your Liability.

a.&nbsp;General.&nbsp;You are responsible for all Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, a User, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this Agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal Services.
You agree to reimburse PayPal, a User, or a third party for any and all such liability.
b.&nbsp;Liability for Claims under PayPal Buyer Protection.&nbsp;If you are a Seller and you lose a Claim filed directly with PayPal, you will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability.
Where you receive payment from a PayPal Account holder in another country/region&nbsp;and we determine under the Buyer Protection policy of that country/region&nbsp;that the funds received should be returned or reversed, you will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability (before receiving payment from a PayPal Account holder in another country/region, you should review the relevant PayPal Buyer Protection policies available&nbsp;here).
Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal Fees that you were charged for the transaction.
PayPal Seller Protection will cover your liability for eligible Claims based on Item not Received, and eligible Unauthorized Transactions - see Section 9 (PayPal Seller Protection) above.
 If a buyer files a Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) Claim for an item he or she purchased from you, you will generally be required to accept the item back and refund the buyer the full purchase price plus original shipping costs.
You will not receive a refund on your PayPal Fees.
Further, if you lose a SNAD Claim because we, in our sole discretion, reasonably believe the item you sold is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you might not receive the item back from the buyer (for instance, it may be disposed of or otherwise irreversibly dealt with).
PayPal Seller Protection will not cover your liability for SNAD Claims.
c.&nbsp;Liability for claims filed under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee program.&nbsp;If you are an eBay Seller and eBay makes a final decision pursuant to its eBay Money Back Guarantee program holding you liable to reimburse the buyer, then you authorize PayPal to remove funds from your Account in an amount not greater than the amount of such claim and remit such funds to eBay.
d.&nbsp;Liability for instructions given by you on your Account.&nbsp;Any instructions given by you on your Account (whether verbal or in writing) once you have been authenticated will be relied on by PayPal.
PayPal will not be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else suffers where PayPal acts on those instructions in good faith, unless it was proved that PayPal was negligent.

11.2 Reimbursement for Your Liability.&nbsp;In the event that you are liable for any amounts owed to PayPal, PayPal may immediately remove such amounts from your balance.
If you do not have a balance that is sufficient to cover your liability, your remaining balance (if any) will be removed, your Account will have negative balance up to the amount of your liability, and you will be required to immediately Add Money to your PayPal balance or reimburse PayPal through an alternative method.
If you do not do so, PayPal may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.

11.3 Actions by PayPal – Restricted Activities.&nbsp;If PayPal, in its sole discretion, believes that you may have engaged in any Restricted Activities, we may take various actions to protect PayPal, Affiliates other Users, other third parties or you from Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability.
The actions we may take include but are not limited to the following:

We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Account or the PayPal Services;
We may suspend your eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection and/or PayPal Seller Protection;
We may hold, apply or transfer the funds in your Account as required by judgments and orders which&nbsp;affect you or your Account, including judgments and orders&nbsp;issued by courts in Singapore or elsewhere and directed to PayPal or its Affiliates;
We may refuse to provide the PayPal Services to you now and in the future.
and
We may hold your funds for a period of time reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability to PayPal or a third party, or if we believe that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions.


11.4 Actions by PayPal - Holds.



Risk-Based Holds.&nbsp;PayPal, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on any or all of the payments you receive when PayPal believes there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions.
PayPal’s determination may be based on different factors and PayPal may rely on information it receives from third parties.
If PayPal places a hold on a payment, the funds will appear as pending balance or withheld and the payment status will indicate the hold.
If PayPal places a hold on any or all of the payments you receive, PayPal will provide you with notice of our actions.
PayPal will release the hold on any payment after 30 Days from the date the payment was received into your Account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment such as (a) the receipt of a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback, or Reversal, (b) PayPal believes that you have violated the terms of this Agreement or any other Policy and that such a violation results in the need to continue holding the funds, or (c) PayPal believes that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions.
In such an event, PayPal may continue holding the payment in your Account until the matter is resolved pursuant to this Agreement.
PayPal, in its sole discretion, may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances, for example when you upload tracking information of the item you shipped.

Disputed Transaction Holds.&nbsp;If a User files a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback or Reversal on a payment you received, PayPal may place a temporary hold on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of the liability.
If you win the dispute or the transaction is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, PayPal will lift the temporary hold.
If you lose the dispute, PayPal will remove the funds from your Account.
This process also applies to any claim that a buyer files directly with eBay through the eBay Money Back Guarantee program, provided that your Account is your reimbursement method for amounts you owe to eBay or to the buyer (as the case may be) under the terms of the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.


11.5 Actions by PayPal - Reserves.

PayPal, in its sole discretion, may place a Reserve on funds held in your Business Account when PayPal believes there may be a high level of risk associated with your Account or your use of any of the products and/or services offered by PayPal and/or its Affiliates.
If PayPal places a Reserve in your Account, transactions will be shown as "pending" in your PayPal balance, and you will not have access to funds in a “pending” status until they are cleared.
If your Account is subject to a Reserve, PayPal will provide you with notice specifying the terms of the Reserve.
The terms may require that a certain percentage of the amounts received into your Account are held for a certain period of time, or that a certain amount of money is held in Reserve, or anything else that PayPal determines is necessary to protect against the risk associated with your Account.
PayPal may change the terms of the Reserve at any time by providing you with notice of the new terms.

11.6 Actions by PayPal - Account Closure, Termination of Service, Limited Account Access.
Confidential Criteria.&nbsp;PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and/or access to the PayPal Services for any reason and at any time upon notice and payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your balance.
If we limit access to your Account, including through a Reserve or hold, we will provide you with notice of our actions, and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate.
Further, you acknowledge that PayPal’s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to your Account, placing holds or imposing Reserves, may be based on confidential criteria that is essential to our management of risk, the security of Users’ Accounts and the PayPal system.
You agree that PayPal is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management or its security procedures to you.

11.7 Acceptable Use Policy Violations.&nbsp;If you violate the&nbsp;Acceptable Use Policy&nbsp;then in addition to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal’s damages for each violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.
You agree that $2,500.00 USD (or equivalent) per transaction in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate.
PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in the offending Account, or any other Account you control.
11.8 Compliance with Data Protection Laws.&nbsp;With regard to any personal data processed by either Party in connection with this Agreement, the Parties will respectively each be a controller in respect of such processing.
Each Party agrees to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Laws applicable to controllers in respect of the provision of the Company Services and otherwise in connection with this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, PayPal and the Merchant each have their own, independently determined privacy policies, notices and procedures for the personal data they hold and are each a data controller (and not joint data controllers).
11.9 In complying with the Data Protection Laws, each Party shall, without limitation:

implement and maintain at all times all appropriate security measures in relation to the processing of personal data;
maintain a record of all processing activities carried out under this Agreement.
and
not knowingly do anything or permit anything to be done which might lead to a breach by the other Party of the Data Protection Laws.

12.7 Insolvency Proceedings.&nbsp;If any proceeding by or against you is commenced under any provision of any bankruptcy or insolvency law, PayPal will be entitled to recover all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement.

12.8 Release of PayPal.&nbsp;If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release PayPal and Affiliates (and their officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

 Where a currency conversion is offered by PayPal at the point of sale, you will be shown the exchange rate that will be applied to the transaction before you proceed with authorizing the payment transaction.
By proceeding with your authorization of the payment transaction you are agreeing to the currency conversion on the basis of the exchange rate.
Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the Merchant, not by PayPal, and you choose to authorize the payment transaction on the basis of the Merchant’s exchange rate and charges, PayPal has no liability to you for that currency conversion.
 Where your payment is funded by a Debit or Credit Card and involves a currency conversion by PayPal, you consent to and authorize PayPal to convert the currency in place of your Credit or Debit card issuer.
