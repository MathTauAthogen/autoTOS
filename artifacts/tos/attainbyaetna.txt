Aetna’s Privacy Statement – Attain By Aetna

&nbsp;
This Privacy Statement describes practices of Aetna (Aetna, we or us) in connection with information we collect, use and disclose through "Attain By Aetna,” a healthcare program (the program) featuring a mobile application (App) used with the Apple Watch and iPhone to combine sensor and clinical health data to allow participants to complete certain healthy living activities and to receive smart message notifications about healthy living engagement activities.
&nbsp;
This Privacy Statement encompasses information collected from eligible Aetna members who complete the “Consent to Participate” in the Attain By Aetna program.
The Consents are visible in the Settings Tab of the Attain By Aetna App – see View Participation Agreement in the App.
Some of the information collected for the program will come through your use of the App, while other information used in the program, such as your health plan coverage and claim activity, will come from your Aetna account.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
We are committed to treating your information with care and respect and managing Attain By Aetna in a manner which is compliant with applicable law.
&nbsp;

What types of information do we collect?

&nbsp;
We may collect two basic types of information: Personal Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
&nbsp;
By “Personal Information,” we mean data that is associated with an identifiable individual, such as a name, address or e-mail address.
In connection with health insurance, personal information includes, for example, personally identifiable coverage and claim information.
And in connection with participation in Attain By Aetna, it also includes personally identifiable wellness or fitness information, including various activities identified through the App on your Apple Watch or iPhone.
&nbsp;
By “Non-Personally-Identifiable Information,” we mean information that is not associated with an identifiable individual.
Non-Personally-Identifiable information may include information which would otherwise be personal information, but which has been de-identified or aggregated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The full listing of information that may be collected, used or disclosed as part of your use of Attain, including information collected through the App and other information from Aetna, is described in the “Consent to Participate” for the Attain By Aetna program.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

How do we acquire and use personal information?

&nbsp;
We acquire Personal Information through your membership in an Aetna health plan and our related health care operations, as well as through your use of your Apple Watch or iPhone when you consent to participate in Attain By Aetna.
&nbsp;
For example, in connection with your participation in Attain By Aetna, in addition to your contact and demographic information, we will collect information about your medical conditions and medications, about your health care services use, about your health care coverage, as well as information concerning program activities (e.g., sleep related information, workout related information) coming from your Apple Watch or iPhone.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
If you consent to participate in the Attain By Aetna, the information&nbsp;you share will never be sold or used for any underwriting, eligibility, premium or coverage decisions.
It may be used, for example, in support of the program to adjudicate rewards, to identify and deliver messages that may be helpful to your health or otherwise of interest to you.
&nbsp;
Except in connection with the sale, transfer, merger, consolidation or other transaction involving all or part of our company, we will not sell, license or, except as described below, otherwise transfer any rights to your Personal Information to any third party.
&nbsp;

For what and to whom may disclose your Personal Information?

&nbsp;
We may disclose your Personal Information to Aetna affiliates or to third parties for the following purposes.&nbsp;In all cases we will require the recipient to protect the Personal Information and use it only for the purpose it was provided consistent with this Privacy Statement.
&nbsp;

To enable affiliates and third parties to perform certain services for us in connection with the Attain program, including, but not limited to,&nbsp;program and incentive administration, application maintenance and performance improvement tasks through the Program.
For example, if you choose to participate in the program then you also have the option to opt-in and allow Aetna to share your data collected under the program with a wholly owned Apple subsidiary, Ollopa, in order to help build and improve your Attain experience and the Attain program.
If you opt-in, your Contact Information and other information that directly identifies you will be separated from the rest of your data collected under the program and replaced with a random code before it is provided to Apple or Apple’s subsidiary.
If required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena, regulatory oversight, or other legal process.
If we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary (a) to protect our rights, the integrity of the application, or your safety or the safety of others, or (b) to detect, prevent, or respond to fraud, intellectual property infringement, violations of our Terms of Use, violations of law, or other misuse of the application.

&nbsp;
We will not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from minors under the age of eighteen (18) without their parents’ consent as required by applicable law.
&nbsp;

How do we acquire and use non-personally identifiable information?

&nbsp;
When you use Attain By Aetna, &nbsp;we collect certain Non-Personally-Identifiable Information about you.
This data helps us to analyze and improve the usefulness of the information and services we provide through the Program.
Because Non-Personally Identifiable Information does not personally identify you, we may use and disclose such information for any purpose permitted by law and in support of the Program or as otherwise described in the Consents to Participate.
&nbsp;

How do we protect your information?

&nbsp;
The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us.&nbsp;We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification.&nbsp;We regularly review our security practices to consider appropriate new technology and methods.&nbsp;We also periodically subject Attain to simulated intrusion tests and have developed comprehensive disaster recovery plans.
However, please be aware that despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

&nbsp;
You may also be withdrawn from the program if you no longer are an Aetna member, for non-payment if you finance your Apple Watch in connection with the program, or if you engage in any practices that are found to violate any participation terms.
&nbsp;
