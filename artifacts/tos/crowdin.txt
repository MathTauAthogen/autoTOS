This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the information that we gather on or through the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information.
By visiting the Site, or by purchasing or using the Service, you accept the privacy practices described in this Policy.
This Policy is incorporated into, and is subject to, the Crowdin Terms of Service.
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Crowdin Terms of Service. 1.

2.
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON THE SERVICE We collect different types of information from or through the Service.
The legal bases for Crowdin’s processing of personal data are primarily that the processing is necessary for providing the Service in accordance with Crowdin’s Terms of Service and that the processing is carried out in Crowdin’s legitimate interests, which are further explained in the section “How We Use the Information We Collect” of this Policy.
We may also process data upon your consent, asking for it as appropriate. 2.1 User-provided Information When you use the Service, as a User or as a Visitor, you may provide, and we may collect Personal Data.
Examples of Personal Data include name, email address, mailing address, and credit card or other billing information.
Personal Data also includes other information, such as geographic area or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual.
You may provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Service.
For example, when you register for an Account, use the Service, post Client Data, interact with other users of the Service through communication or messaging capabilities, or send us customer service -related requests. 2.2 Information Collected by Clients A Client or User may store or upload into the Service Client Data.
Crowdin has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Data it hosts as part of Client Data.
Each Client is responsible for providing notice to its customers and third persons concerning the purpose for which Client collects their Personal Data and how this Personal Data is processed in or through the Service as part of Client Data. 2.3 “Automatically Collected” Information When a User or Visitor uses the Service, we may automatically record certain information from the User’s or Visitor’s device by using various types of technology, including cookies, “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This “automatically collected” information may include IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites visited just before or just after using the Service, the pages or other content the User or Visitor views or interacts with on the Service, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or use of the Service.
We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding a Visitor or User’s interaction with email messages, such as whether the Visitor or User opens, clicks on, or forwards a message.
This information is gathered from all Users and Visitors.
Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed more below, and in more detail in our Cookie Statement here. 2.4 Integrated Services You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of your Google account, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide Personal Data or other information to us.

You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand what information that Integrated Service makes available to us, and make changes as appropriate.
Please review each Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service. 2.5 Information from Other Sources We may obtain information, including Personal Data, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers and Integrated Services.
If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Data that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data in accordance with this Policy. 3.

We process Client Data solely in accordance with the directions provided by the applicable Client or User. 3.2 Improvements We use the information to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Visitors and Users, to improve the Service, and to develop new products, services, feature, and functionality.
Should this purpose require Crowdin to process Client Data, then the data will only be used in anonymized or aggregated form. 3.3 Communications We may use a Visitor’s or User’s email address or other information – other than Client Data – to contact that Visitor or User (i) for administrative purposes such as customer service, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to the Client Data or Personal Data posted on the Service or (ii) with updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with.
You have the ability to opt-out of receiving any promotional communications as described below under “Your Choices.” 3.4 Cookies and Tracking Technologies We use automatically collected information and other information collected on the Service through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering a User’s or Visitor’s information so that the User or Visitor will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits.

Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity, that you can regulate from profile settings.
You can review and revise your profile information at any time. 4.2 Service Providers We work with third party service providers who provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for us.
These third parties may have access to, or process Personal Data or Client Data as part of providing those services for us.
We limit the information provided to these service providers to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and our contracts with them require them to maintain the confidentiality of such information. 4.3 Non Personally Identifiable Information We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations.

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES The Service may contain features or links to web sites and services provided by third parties.
Any information you provide on third-party sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service.

We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information. 7.
INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different sources and across different platforms in order to predict an individual’s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual, or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile or similar interests.
We work with a variety of third parties to attempt to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be interested in the Crowdin products or services so that we can send them promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites and mobile apps of other entities.
These third parties include: (i) advertising networks, which collect information about a person’s interests when that person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.
(ii) attribution partners, which measure the effectiveness of certain advertisements.
and (iii) business partners, which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of their advertisements.
In collaboration with these third parties, we collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms or interact with them.
Individuals may submit information directly on our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third parties.
We may use special tools that are commonly used for this purpose, such as cookies, pixels, and similar technologies.
We may have access to databases of information collected by our business partners.
The information we or third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made, what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties’ platforms.
We, or the third parties with which we work, use the information collected as described above to understand the various activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others.
We, or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to recognize new or past visitors to our Sites.
to present more personalized content.
to provide more useful and relevant ads - for example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you the same ones repeatedly.
to identify visitors across devices, sales channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more focused on a person’s perceived interest in products or services similar to those that we offer.
Our interest-based ads may be served to you in emails or on third-party platforms.
We may serve these ads about our products or services or send commercial communications directly ourselves or through these third parties.
Crowdin does not provide any personal information to the third party sites that display interest-based ads promoting Crowdin. 8.
THIRD PARTY COOKIES We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Site.
These third parties include (i) business partners, which collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on the Site.
and (ii) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of their advertisements.
The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your interests or preferences so that they can display advertisements or promotional material on this Site and on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.
The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to serve you advertisements that are tailored to your apparent interests.
It is possible that they may reuse this small amount of information on other sites or services.
We do not share with these third parties any information that would readily identify you (such as email address).
however, these third parties may have access to information about your device (such as IP or MAC address).
We do not have access to, or control over, the technologies that these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice.
Other than as discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties. 8.1 The Following Types of Cookies Are Used in the Site 
strictly necessary/essential cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website.
Without these cookies services you have asked for cannot be provided.
These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor.
functionality cookies - These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features.
For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located.
These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise.
They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.
The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
behaviourally targeted advertising cookies - These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests.
They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns.
They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission.
They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers.
Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

For more information about these and a full list of the cookies we use, what they do, and how to disable the non-necessary ones, please refer to our full Cookie Statement . 9.
MINORS AND CHILDREN’S PRIVACY Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.
Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 18 without obtaining parental consent.
If you are under 18 years of age, then please do not use or access the Service at any time or in any manner.
If we learn that Personal Data has been collected on the Service from persons under 18 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 18 years of age has obtained an Account on the Service, then you may alert us at privacy@crowdin.com and request that we delete that child’s Personal Data from our systems.
The Service is not intended to be used by minors, and is not intended to be used to post content to share publicly or with friends.
To the extent that a minor has posted such content on the Service, the minor has the right to have this content deleted or removed using the deletion or removal options detailed in this Privacy Policy.
If you have any question regarding this topic, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section.
Please be aware that, although we offer this deletion capability, the removal of content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information. 10.
DATA SECURITY We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession.
This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls.
We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through public internet, and we also employ application-layer security features to further anonymize Personal Data.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service, and you do so at your own risk.
We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section.
If we learn of a security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law. 11.
DATA RETENTION We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the User’s account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfill the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.
We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements as follows:

the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the date of closure
backups are kept for 3 months
billing information is retained for a period of 7 years as of their provision to Crowdin in accordance with the Estonian accounting and taxation laws
information on legal transactions between Client and Crowdin is retained for a period of 10 years as of their provision to Crowdin in accordance with the general limitation period set for civil claims in the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act
 12.
SETTINGS Although we may allow you to adjust your privacy settings to limit access to certain Personal Data, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the Service.
Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your information.
Further, even after information posted on the Service is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Service.
We cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on or transmit to the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. 13.
DATA TRANSFER We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S.
The U.S.
may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services.
When we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.
The Service is hosted in the United States or Germany.
Regardless of the database being hosted in the EU, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.
law, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Crowdin Terms of Service.
We will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S.
Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. 14.
DATA CONTROLLER AND DATA PROCESSOR Crowdin does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service.
Only the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data.
Crowdin is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.
Because Crowdin does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Crowdin is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter “GDPR”) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR.
Crowdin should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR.
Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, Crowdin does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Crowdin in connection with Crowdin’s provision of Services to Clients.
Such actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.
The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.
Crowdin is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Crowdin responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.
If you need a signed Data Processing Addendum in addition to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you can find the document signed on behalf of Crowdin here. 15.
CHANGES AND UPDATES TO THIS POLICY Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time.
If we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law.
Your continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy. 16.
HOW TO CONTACT US Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Policy, your Personal Data, our use and disclosure practices, your consent choices, or if you have any concerns or complaints about this Policy or your Personal Data, by email at privacy@crowdin.com.
Your Crowdin Team.
