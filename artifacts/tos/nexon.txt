VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND VIRTUAL ITEMS
While using the Services, you may have the opportunity to visit online and in-game stores where you can obtain and use Nexon’s virtual currency and digital, in-game items (including early access to games still in production, as may be offered from time to time).
Nexon also may make points available to you in connection with your use of the Services.
VIRTUAL CONTENTS, INCLUDING VIRTUAL CONTENTS EXCHANGED FOR PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS, ARE REGARDED AS GOODS OR SERVICES, AND ARE NOT PREPAID PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS.
Virtual currency and points have no “real-world” value but may be exchanged for in-game items.
Items from such stores are not purchased by you, but rather are licensed to you under these Terms.
REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY, YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN THE ITEMS OBTAINED WITH VIRTUAL CURRENCY.
Any prices, quotations and descriptions made or referred to on our Services do not constitute an offer and may be withdrawn or revised at any time before Nexon’s express acceptance of your order.
To the extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to pay all charges, fees, and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone else using your account or resulting from use of the Services on your device at the price(s) in effect when such charges occurred.
Nexon may change the pricing for the Services at any time consistent with applicable law.
Nexon reserves the right to notify you of any mistakes in product descriptions or errors in pricing prior to product dispatch.
If that happens, and you choose to continue with fulfilment of the order, you acknowledge that the product or service will be provided in accordance with such revised description or corrected price.
Different payment methods, such as credit card, direct debit, PayPal, Karma Koin, etc., may be available to you when obtaining virtual currency through the Services.
When you use third-party payment and billing providers, such as PayPal, that provider’s additional terms, conditions, and costs, apply.
It is your obligation to pay all federal, state, and local taxes associated with the receipt or use of the virtual items which you purchase from Nexon.
Certain minimums may apply to purchases of virtual currency, and certain maximums may apply depending on your transaction method.
Nexon reserves the right to change the maximum and minimum amounts applicable to virtual currency purchases at any time without notice, consistent with applicable law.
YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEXON WILL NOT OFFER REFUNDS FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR DIGITAL, IN-GAME ITEMS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT, THESE TERMS, OR THE SERVICES, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
If an account is permanently banned, all content licenses and virtual currency balances associated with the suspended account are forfeited.
Nexon will have no obligation or responsibility to and will not reimburse you for any virtual currency, points, items, or experience lost due to your violation of these Terms.
Items may expire.
Each item that you obtain using virtual currency or points will be included in your account until the earlier of the item’s expiration date, termination or expiration of your account, these Terms, or the Services.
Price and availability of items are subject to change without notice, consistent with applicable law.
We may suspend or terminate your account if for any reason a charge you authorize us to make to your credit card or SMS/phone billing cannot be processed or is returned to us unpaid or refunded and, if such event occurs, you shall immediately remit to us payment for such charge through the use of another credit card or other payment mechanism.
We are not responsible or liable for any credit card or bank-related charges or fees related to any of your transactions.
We reserve the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item or to refuse to provide you with any item.
You may be required to verify your transaction information prior to our acceptance thereof.
Notwithstanding these Terms, the laws in your country may apply to the purchase of virtual goods and services supplied by Nexon to you and you may have rights or remedies as set out in such laws that apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in these Terms.
As for the Services provided in Japan, only virtual contents or in-game items that are shown as Prepaid Payment Instruments on the websites titled “Representation in accordance with the Payment Services Act in Japan” or “Prepaid Payment Instruments” shall be deemed as “Prepaid Payment Instruments” under the Payment Services Act in Japan.
All other virtual contents or in-game items to be exchanged for by such “Prepaid Payment Instruments” are considered to be goods or services delivered in the game and are not considered as “Prepaid Payment Instruments” under the Payment Services Act.
Unless otherwise provided for under the said Act, any “Prepaid Payment Instruments” shall not be refunded.

X.
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
This Section X does not apply to residents of Japan, the European Union, or the European Economic Area.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.

In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Nexon and you both agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to the Services (“Dispute”) will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:
Notice of Dispute.
In the event of a Dispute, you or we must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution.
You must send any Notice of Dispute by mail and email to us at the mailing and email addresses provided in the Contact Us section.
We will send any Notice of Dispute to you by mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address.

Small Claims Court.
You may choose to litigate any Dispute in small claims court (or the equivalent) in the Forum specified in Section IX, if the Dispute meets all the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
Binding Arbitration.
If the Dispute is not resolved in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section.
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act or any other applicable law.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.
Exceptions to Arbitration.
You and Nexon agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration:
• Any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Nexon’s intellectual property rights.
• Any claim for injunctive relief.
• Any claim you are authorized to bring to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, permit those authorities to seek relief from us on your behalf.
Class Action Waiver.
Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
Neither you nor we will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.
Arbitration Procedures.
Any arbitration will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (“JAMS”) under the applicable Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.
If JAMS is unavailable or unable to conduct an arbitration of the Dispute, an alternative arbitration service provider will be mutually agreed upon by both parties.
You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS rules.
In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
Arbitrator’s Jurisdiction.
The arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
Arbitration Fees.
Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee.
If we file, we pay.
If you file, you pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.
All other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law.
Each party will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.
Location of Arbitration.
You agree that the arbitration will occur in the following location:
Game Publisher
Arbitration Forum
Nexon America Inc.
and Nexon M Inc.
A reasonable location in the United States, as agreed to by both parties, or, if necessary, as determined by the arbitrator.
Nexon Korea Corporation
A reasonable location in South Korea, as agreed to by both parties, or, if necessary, as determined by the arbitrator.

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
When you use the Services or interact with emails from us, we and our third-party business partners may collect and store information about your use of our Services using cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and similar technologies.

Cookies are small files that are automatically generated when you visit a website and are stored on your device.
Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your device.
Local storage is similar to a cookie except that it can store larger amounts of information and can be stored elsewhere on your device.

We use cookies and similar technologies (collectively, “cookies”) for the following functions and purposes: 
Function
Purpose
Analytics and Research
 We use analytics and research cookies to collect information about how visitors use our Services, including the total number of people that use our Services and the types of devices they use.
We may use the information to compile reports of aggregated and de-identified information and to help make improvements to the Services.

Authentication
These cookies help us to identify our users so that when you are signed in, you can enjoy the Services and features fully.
These cookies are essential and cannot be blocked if you wish to use the Services.

Service Features and Performance
We use feature-tracking cookies to collect information about how our Services are performing.
We may use the information to compile reports and to help make improvements to the Services.

Please note that even if you have opted out of receiving commercial email messages, you may continue to receive messages related to your account, your transactions, and similar service-related messages.

Geolocation Information.
Your device may enable you to control the collection of your precise geolocation information, and whether this information is shared with third parties, through the settings on your device.
Please note that you may need to adjust multiple settings, and not just your location permissions, to opt out of providing precise location information.
If you opt out of providing precise geolocation information, we may continue to derive your approximate location from your IP address and other information we may collect.
For more information, please review your device settings.

Cookies and Similar Technologies.

Because each web browser is different, please consult the instructions provided by your web browser (typically in the “help” section).
Please note that you may need to take additional steps to refuse or disable local storage and similar technologies.
For example, Adobe Local Shared Objects can be controlled through the instructions on Adobe’s Setting Manager page.
Deleting the cookies in your browser may in some cases cancel your choices for interest-based advertising.
If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete cookies and similar technologies, some of the functionality of the Services may no longer be available to you.

Do Not Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
Nexon currently does not take action in response to these signals.
Interest-Based Advertising.While it is not possible to turn off all advertising, you do have the ability to control whether you receive interest-based ads based on information collected or received about your online activities and interests over time and across unaffiliated sites and services and your different devices.
You can opt out of receiving interest-based ads from companies that participate in self-regulatory programs such as the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), EDAA (EU), and DAAC (Canada) by following the instructions provided on their websites.
If you are using a mobile app, you also may need to opt out of interest-based advertising on your mobile device or through the mobile application.

You may be able to adjust your privacy settings for push notifications, address book sharing, and other information or features within the Services or your device permissions.
Please review the settings for the Services and your device for more information.
To stop the collection of information by a Nexon game, you can uninstall the game using the standard uninstall process available on your device or the app marketplace or network from which you installed the game.

Data Rights and Withdrawal of Consent

If you withdraw your consent, we will stop processing your information for such purposes, but it will not affect the processing of information previously covered by your consent.
Where technologically feasible and required by applicable law, we will port your information pursuant to your reasonable request.
A request to withdraw consent, restrict or stop processing your information, or delete your account or information may result in your inability to access the Services or some of its features.
