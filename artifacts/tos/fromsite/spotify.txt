1. Introduction
Thanks for choosing Spotify!
At Spotify, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service. To do this we need to understand your streaming habits so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. Your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.
That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy ("Policy") will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.
2. About this Policy
This Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with Spotify USA Inc. The Policy applies to all Spotify services and any associated services (referred to as the 'Spotify Service'). The terms governing your use of the Spotify Service are defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use (the "Terms and Conditions of Use").
From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any material change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information or additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.
The aim of this Policy is to:
Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;
Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using the Spotify Service; and
Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.
We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For further clarification of the terms used in this Policy please visit our Privacy Centeron spotify.com. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, please see Section 13 'How to contact us' below. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use the Spotify Service.
3. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control
The General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we are happy to offer transparency and access controls to help users take advantage of those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:
Right of access - the right to be informed of, and request access to, the personal data we process about you;
Right to rectification - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;
Right to erasure - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
Right to restrict - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
Right to object -
the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
Right to data portability - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party's service; and
Right not to be subject to automated decision-making - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.
In order to enable you to learn more about these rights, exercise these rights with ease, and record your preferences in relation to how Spotify uses your personal data, we provide the following resources:
Privacy Settings (accessed via your account page) - allows you to exercise choices about the processing of certain personal data, and an automated 'Download your data' function to download basic account and usage information.
Privacy Center - provides a convenient central location where you can find more information about how Spotify uses your personal data, your rights in relation to your personal data, and how to exercise those rights.
Notification Settings (accessed via your account page) - allows you to choose which marketing communications you receive from Spotify. You may toggle these settings to opt in or out of receiving different types of email and push notifications. Please note that email marketing messages from Spotify include an opt-out mechanism within the message itself (e.g. an unsubscribe link in the emails we send to you). Clicking on the link in an email will opt you out of further messages of that category (e.g. Artist Updates). You can use the Notification Settings page to exercise choices about all categories of email and push marketing communication.
Cookies Policy - provides more information on how we use cookies, including for interest-based advertising. You will also find information about how you can manage your cookie preferences and opt-out of certain types of tracking; and
Customer Support resources - We have several pages on our customer support site which provide further guidance about data protection questions. A key source of information is the Data Rights and Privacy Settings article which includes answers to "frequently asked questions" about personal data processing in the Spotify Service.
If you have any questions about your privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the 'Contact Us' form on the Privacy Center. If you have concerns around our processing of your personal data, we hope you will continue to work with us to resolve them. However, you can also contact and have the right to lodge a complaint with the Swedish Data Protection Authority (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) or your local Data Protection Authority.
Additional privacy rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) can be found in our supplemental policy "Additional California Privacy Disclosures", which contains supplemental disclosures relating to the processing of your personal data.

The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service: your name and/or username, profile picture, who you follow and who follows you on the Spotify Service, your recently played artists, and your public playlists.
Personal data you may choose to share
The following personal data will only be shared with the categories of recipients outlined in the table below if:

you grant us your permission to share the personal data, e.g. by selecting the appropriate setting in the Spotify Service or authorizing Spotify through a presented consent mechanism.
Categories of Recipients
Reason for sharing
Third party applications and devices you connect to your Spotify Account
If you connect your Spotify account to a third party application and/or device(s), such as, social media, audio, television, or automotive platforms and services, Spotify shares technical data with the operator of that third party application and/or device in order to connect your Spotify account, and/or facilitate playback of the Spotify Service.With respect to certain third parties which may request or require that we share your information with them, your permission will be requested before we provide your information to such third parties.
Support community
When you register for a Spotify Support Account on the Spotify Support Community, we will ask you to create a specific Spotify Support Community username. This will be publicly displayed to anyone who accesses the Spotify Support Community along with any questions or comments you post.
Your Spotify followers
There may be times when you want us to share information about your use of the Spotify Service with other Spotify users known as ‘Your Spotify Followers’. For example, you have the ability to make both private and public playlists. If you share your private playlists with others, please be aware that the recipients of your private playlists can further share those playlists with others.

Learn more about how to manage notifications, your publicly available information, and what you share with others in Section 3 'Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control' of this Policy and on the Privacy Center.
Information we may share
Categories of Recipients
Reason for sharing
Service providers
We work with service providers that work on our behalf which may need access to certain personal data in order to provide their services to us. These companies include those we've hired to provide customer service support, operate the technical infrastructure that we need to provide the Spotify Service, assist in protecting and securing our systems and services, and help market Spotify’s own products and services as well as partner products, services, events, and co-branded promotions in which Spotify is involved.
Payment processors
We will share your personal data with our payment processors as necessary to enable them to process your payments, and for anti-fraud purposes.
Advertising partners
We work with advertising partners to enable us to customize the advertising content you may receive on the Spotify Service. These partners help us deliver more relevant ads and promotional messages to you, which may include interest based advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising), contextual advertising, and generic advertising on the Spotify Service. We and our advertising partners may process certain personal data to help Spotify understand your interests or preferences so that we can deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you.
Spotify partners
Depending on how you sign up for the Spotify Service (e.g. through a third party service or a mobile provider), we share your Spotify username or other User Data as necessary to enable your account. We may also share personal data with that third party about your use of the Spotify Service, such as whether and to what extent you have used the offer, activated a Spotify account, or actively used the Spotify Service. We also may share your personal data in a pseudonymised format with our music industry partners to help them understand how the content they license to us is performing and to enable you to listen to streaming content via the Spotify Service.
Academic researchers
We will share your personal data for activities such as statistical analysis and academic study but only in a pseudonymised format.
Other Spotify group companies
We will share your personal data with other Spotify group companies to carry out our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide the Spotify Service to you.
Law enforcement and data protection authorities
We share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena. We also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party’s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.
Purchasers of our business
We will share your personal data in those cases where we sell or negotiate to sell our business to a buyer or prospective buyer. In this situation, Spotify will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal data and give you notice before your personal data is transferred to the buyer or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
7. Data retention and deletion
We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of the Spotify Service, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes. We keep some of your personal data for as long as you are a user of the Spotify Service. For example, we keep your playlists, song library, and account information.
If you request, we will delete or anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, unless we are legally allowed or required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:
If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary personal data until the issue is resolved;
Where we need to retain the personal data for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain the necessary personal data for the period required by applicable law; and/or,
Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.
8. Transfer to other countries
Spotify shares your personal data globally with Spotify group companies in order to carry out the activities specified in this Policy. Spotify may also subcontract processing to, or share your personal data with, third parties located in countries other than your country. Your personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country.
Personal data collected within the European Union and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties located in a country outside of the European Union and Switzerland. In such instances Spotify shall ensure that the transfer of your personal data is carried out in accordance with applicable privacy laws and, in particular, that appropriate contractual, technical, and organisational measures are in place such as the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission.
For further details of the security measures we use to protect your personal data, please see Section 10 'Keeping your personal data safe' of this Policy.
9. Links
We may display advertisements from third parties and other content that links to third-party websites. We cannot control or be held responsible for third parties' privacy practices and content. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link, please understand that you are leaving the Spotify Service and any personal data you provide will not be covered by this Policy. Please read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.
10. Keeping your personal data safe
We are committed to protecting our users' personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your personal data; however, please note that no system is ever completely secure. We have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.
Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your Spotify account, never share your password with anyone, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Spotify Service.
11. Children
With the exception of Spotify Kids, a separate Spotify application available in certain markets, the Spotify Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 years. The Spotify Service is also not offered to children whose age makes it illegal to process their personal data or requires parental consent for the processing of their personal data under the GDPR or other local law.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years or under the applicable age limit (the "Age Limit"). If you are under the Age Limit, please do not use the Spotify Service, and do not provide any personal data to us.
If you are a parent of a child under the Age Limit and become aware that your child has provided personal data to Spotify, please contact us using the 'Contact Us' form on the Privacy Center, and you may request exercise of your applicable rights detailed in Section 3 'Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control' of this Policy.
If we learn that we have collected the personal data of a child under the age of 13 years, we will take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child.
12. Changes to this Policy
We may occasionally make changes to this Policy.
When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or by sending you an email and/or a device notification. We may notify you in advance.
Please, therefore, make sure you read any such notice carefully.
If you want to find out more about this Policy and how Spotify uses your personal data, please visit the Privacy Center on spotify.com to find out more.

Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify
Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify
Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration
Please read these Terms, our Privacy Policy and any other terms referenced in this document carefully. We hope you're sitting comfortably and listening to some great music. Here we go...
1 Introduction
Thanks for choosing Spotify ("Spotify," "we," "us," "our"). Spotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time. By signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the "Spotify Service" or "Service"), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the "Content") you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.
Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the "Agreements"). The Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, export controls, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify's website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don't agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian's consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.
2 Changes to the Agreements
Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we'll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by contacting us. If you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.
3 Enjoying Spotify
Here's some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.
3.1 Service Options
You can find a description of our Service options on our website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account. Certain options are provided to you free-of-charge. The Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the "Free Service." Other options require payment before you can access them (the "Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.
The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.
If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("Code"), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions. You may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party. In such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.
3.2 Trials
From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "Trial"). Spotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
For some Trials, we'll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY CLICKING HERE IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.
4 Payments and Cancellations
4.1 Billing
You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("Pre-Paid Period").
Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
4.2 Renewal; Cancellation
Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by clicking here if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.
If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service. If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.
5 Using our service
The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors. We grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, "Access").

16 Term and termination

Other than as set out in this section, the Agreements are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Spotify, and in no event shall the Agreements create any third party beneficiary rights. Furthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.
If you have downloaded the App from the Apple, Inc.

20 Entire Agreement
Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Spotify, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Spotify and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.
Please note, however, that certain aspects of your use of the Spotify Service may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to the Spotify Service as a result of a gift card, free or discounted Trials, or together with other services. When you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms.

21 Severability, waiver and interpretation
Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.

24 Choice of law, mandatory arbitration, and venue
24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction
The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.
24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.
24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration
You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.
24.2.2 Exceptions
Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).
24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver
YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.
24.2.4 Arbitration rules
Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in force (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Spotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.
If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
24.2.5 Notice; Process
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify's last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
24.2.6 Enforceability
If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.
