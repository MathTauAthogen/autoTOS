 SpiderOak One Backup SPIDEROAK SERVICE AGREEMENT
Posted and effective 12 August 2016

This Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between SpiderOak, Inc.
(“SpiderOak”) and the organization agreeing to these terms (“Customer”).
The Agreement governs access to and use of the SpiderOak client software and services (“Services”) by Customer.
By clicking “I Accept,” you acknowledge that you have reviewed the following terms and conditions, have the authority to bind the organization, and accept the Agreement on the organization’s behalf.



SpiderOak Services.
A.Provision of Services.
SpiderOak grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services for Customer’s internal purposes.
Customer and users of Customer’s Services account (“End Users”) may use SpiderOak Services in accordance with this Agreement.
B. Information Security and Data Processing.
SpiderOak will use, at a minimum, industry-standard technical and administrative security measures to transfer, store, and process Customer Data.
These measures are designed to protect the integrity of Customer Data and guard against the unauthorized or unlawful access to, use, and processing of Customer Data.
Customer agrees that SpiderOak may transfer, store, and process Customer Data in the United States and locations other than Customer’s country.
To the extent that Customer Data is subject to European Union data protection laws and is processed by SpiderOak as a data processor acting on Customer’s behalf (as a data controller), SpiderOak will use and process such Customer Data as Customer instructs in order to provide the Services and fulfill SpiderOak’s obligations under the Agreement.
“Stored Data” means files and other data submitted to the Services by Customer or End Users.
“Account Data” means account and contact information submitted to the Services by Customer or End Users.
“Customer Data” means Stored Data and Account Data.
C. Software.
Customer may use SpiderOak software to access the Services.
If any component of the software is offered under an open source license, SpiderOak will make the license available to Customer and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of the terms of this Agreement.
D. Modifications to the Services.
SpiderOak reserves the right to update the Services from time to time.



Customer Duties.
A. Compliance.
Customer is responsible for use of the Services by its End Users.
Customer and its End Users must use the Services in compliance with this Agreement, all SpiderOak policies, and applicable regulations and laws.
B. Customer Administration of the Services.
Customer may designate certain End Users as “Administrators.” Administrators may have the ability to access, disclose, restrict or remove Customer Data in or from Services accounts.
Administrators may also have the ability to monitor, restrict, or terminate access to Services accounts.
SpiderOak is not responsible for the internal management or administration of the Services on behalf of Customer.
Customer must (i) maintain the confidentiality of passwords and Administrator accounts, (ii) manage access to Administrator accounts, and (iii) ensure that Administrators’ use of the Services complies with this Agreement.
Customer will obtain from End Users any consents necessary to allow Administrators to engage in the activities described in this Agreement and to allow SpiderOak to provide the Services.
C. Unauthorized Use and Access.
Customer will prevent unauthorized use of the Services by its End Users and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to the Services.
Customer will ensure that it does not allow any person under 13 to use the Services.
Customer will promptly notify SpiderOak of any unauthorized use of or access to the Services.
D. Restrictions.
Customer will not (i) sell, resell, or lease the Services.
(ii) use the Services in activities wherein use or failure of the Services could cause physical damage, death, or personal injury.
or (iii) reverse engineer the Services, nor assist anyone else to do so, unless otherwise permitted by law.
E. Third-Party Requests.
i.
Customer is responsible for responding directly to Third-Party Requests for information about its End Users’ use of the Services.
“Third-Party Request” means a request from law enforcement or another third party for records relating to an End User’s use of the Services.
Third-Party Requests may include, but are not limited to, search warrants, subpoenas, court orders, emergency disclosure requests, or written consent from an End User permitting disclosure of records about the End User’s use of the Services.
ii.
SpiderOak will make commercially reasonable efforts, unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2705(b)), to (a) promptly notify Customer of SpiderOak’s receipt of a Third-Party Request.
(b) comply with Customer’s commercially reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third-Party Request.
and (c) provide Customer with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third-Party Request (if Customer is otherwise unable to obtain the information).
If Customer fails to promptly respond to a Third-Party Request, SpiderOak may, but will not be obligated, to do so.



Third-Party Services.
If Customer uses any third-party service in conjunction with the Services, (A) SpiderOak will not be responsible for any act or omission of the third party, including the third party’s access to or use of Customer Data and (B) SpiderOak does not warrant or support any service provided by the third party.



Suspension

A. Of End User Accounts by SpiderOak.
If an End User (i) violates this Agreement or (ii) uses the Services in a manner that SpiderOak reasonably believes will cause it liability, then SpiderOak may request that Customer suspend or terminate the applicable End User account.
If Customer fails to promptly suspend or terminate the End User account, SpiderOak may do so.
B. Of Services In Emergencies.
Notwithstanding any term in this Agreement, SpiderOak may suspend the Services in an Emergency.
SpiderOak will make commercially reasonable efforts to tailor the suspension as needed to prevent or stop the Emergency.
“Emergency” means (i) use of the Services that do or could disrupt the Services, other customers’ use of the Services, or the infrastructure used to provide the Services, and (ii) unauthorized third-party access to the Services.



Intellectual Property.
A. Reservation of Rights.
Except as expressly provided, this Agreement does not grant (i) SpiderOak any intellectual property rights in Customer content or data, or (ii) Customer any intellectual property rights in the Services or SpiderOak trademarks and brand features.

SpiderOak may, at its discretion and for any purpose, use, modify, and incorporate into its products and services any feedback, comments, or suggestions from Customer or End Users without any obligation to Customer or End Users.

B. Auto Renewals and Trials.
IF CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT IS SET TO AUTO RENEW OR IS IN A TRIAL PERIOD, SPIDEROAK MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR FOR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS CUSTOMER NOTIFIES SPIDEROAK THAT CUSTOMER WANTS TO CANCEL.
SpiderOak reserves the right to revise Service rates, and will provide Customer at least 10 days notice prior to such a revision.
C. Taxes.
Customer is responsible for all taxes.
SpiderOak will charge tax when required to do so.
If Customer is required by law to withhold any taxes, Customer must provide SpiderOak with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation.
D. Purchase Orders.
If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, Customer (i) must provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase, and (ii) agrees that any terms and conditions on a Customer purchase order will not apply to this Agreement and are null and void.
If Customer is purchasing through a reseller, any terms and conditions from Customer’s reseller or in a purchase order between Customer and its reseller that conflict with the SpiderOak Service Agreement are null and void.



Term &amp.

Indemnification.
A. By Customer.
Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SpiderOak from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim by a third party against SpiderOak and its affiliates regarding (i) Customer Data, (ii) Customer’s use of the Services in violation of this Agreement, or (iii) End Users’ use of the Services in violation of this Agreement.
B. By SpiderOak.
SpiderOak will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim by a third party against Customer to the extent based on an allegation that SpiderOak’s technology used to provide the Services to the Customer infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S.
patent, or trademark right of the third party.
In no event will SpiderOak have any obligations or liability under this section arising from (i) use of any Services in a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished by SpiderOak, and (ii) any content, information, or data provided by Customer, End Users, or other third parties.
C. Possible Infringement.
If SpiderOak believes the Services infringe or may be alleged to infringe a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, then SpiderOak may (i) obtain the right for Customer to continue using the Services, (ii) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement, or (iii) modify the Services so that they no longer infringe.
If SpiderOak does not believe the options described in this section are commercially reasonable, SpiderOak may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the affected Services (with a pro-rata refund of prepaid fees for the Services).
D. General.
The party seeking indemnification will promptly notify the other party of the claim and cooperate with the other party in defending the claim.
The indemnifying party will have full control and authority over the defense, except that (i) any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability requires prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) the other party may join in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense.

We receive some information automatically when you use any SpiderOak product.
This includes data about your device, software, and the operating system you use when accessing our service, approximate amount of data stored on our service, your Internet Protocol address, system-generated error messages for your account, and the date and time of each request you make to SpiderOak.
Additionally, some of our products have access to your team or group name and the number of members in a team. How We Use Your Information We use your personal information to keep SpiderOak running, understand how you use our service, customize your experience, prevent abuse, provide customer support, sell and market our products, and improve SpiderOak.
We use your information internally only as necessary to accomplish these goals. How We Disclose Your Information We share your personally identifiable information only in the limited circumstances below.
SpiderOak never sells your information or shares it with third-party advertisers.
With your permission.
We may share your information with your consent, after letting you know what information will be shared and with whom.
In response to the law.
We may disclose your information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process.
If we are going to release your information, our policy is to provide you with notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2705(b)).
We may disclose your information without giving you prior notice if we believe it’s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you might have to demands to compel disclosure of your information, including demands from the government.

We may share your information with third-party services helping us provide our products and services.
Those third parties access and use the information we share with them only on our behalf.

Your passphrase is only on your device, and we hash and salt it to help protect it against possible compromise.
We limit the number of SpiderOak employees who have access to user data through policy and technical access controls.

You’ll find a few different types of content on our service.
Your Content.
You can back up, host, store, and share your own files on SpiderOak, as well as collaborate and communicate with others using tools like Semaphor and SpiderOak Kloak.
The files and other materials you upload to SpiderOak are yours and yours alone.
You give us permission to use that material solely to do what’s necessary to provide our services, including storing, displaying, reproducing, and distributing the content.
You’re responsible for the content you upload to SpiderOak and assume all risks associated with it, including intellectual property or other legal claims.
By storing and sharing content through SpiderOak, you represent that you have the necessary rights to that material, and that your use of SpiderOak doesn’t conflict with any licenses you’ve granted to others.
You have the option to try out some SpiderOak services on a trial basis (Semaphor in particular).
Please note that we don’t retain content past the timeframe for these trial plans.
Even if you decide to upgrade to another plan later, the content you store with us during the trial period can’t be restored after the trial timeframe expires.
SpiderOakONE, SpiderOak Groups and SpiderOak Semaphor allow you to share your files with others.
Please familiarize yourself with the settings and controls for those services and be careful about what you choose to share with and download from others.

However, we have the right—but no duty—to review and remove files for any reason.
We assume no liability for any content that you or anyone else stores with or shares through SpiderOak.
SpiderOak’s Content and Brand Features.

In more serious cases, we may permanently terminate user accounts.
Section 512 of the DMCA sets out the legal requirements to formally report copyright infringement to a service provider like SpiderOak.
It also explains how the person who posted the content can oppose a notice of alleged infringement by submitting a counter-notice.
Please think carefully before sending us a copyright notice or counter-notice, because the DMCA imposes legal and financial penalties for making fraudulent or bad-faith claims.
If you aren’t sure whether you’re the actual copyright holder or if you’re authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf, check with an attorney before submitting a copyright notice or counter-notice to us. Copyright Infringement Notice Procedure.
To send us a notice concerning copyright infringement, you’ll need to provide the following information:


A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf (typing your full name will do);


Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a copy of or link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed);


Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on our services (e.g., a URL where the allegedly infringing material is located);


Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;


Date you are sending the notice.


A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and


A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.


You can report alleged copyright infringement by emailing the above information to copyright@spideroak.com.
You can also mail a copyright notice to: SpiderOak Copyright Agent, SpiderOak, Inc., 4741 Central Street # 324, Kansas City, MO 64112
Our response to notices of alleged copyright infringement may include removing or restricting access to allegedly infringing material.
If we remove or restrict access to content in response to a copyright notice, we’ll make a good-faith effort to get in touch with the affected account holder to provide information about the situation, including a copy of the takedown notice and instructions for filing a counter-notification.

Copyright Infringement Counter-Notice Procedure.
If you get a message from us about a DMCA complaint, it means that the content identified in the notice has been removed from SpiderOak or access to the content has been restricted.
Please read our message carefully, because it’ll include information about the copyright notice we received and instructions about how to file a counter-notice.


Note
: If you re-post material removed in response to a DMCA notification, we may permanently suspend your account.
If you believe content was removed in error, please consider filing a counter-notice instead of re-posting the material.
If you receive a DMCA notification about material you’ve posted and you believe that material was misidentified or removed in error, you can file a counter-notice by following the instructions below.
To submit a counter-notice, please send us the following information:


A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will do);


Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the URL at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA notice is enough);


A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
and


Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which SpiderOak may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the copyright notification or an agent of such person.

Disclaimers SpiderOak is provided “as is” without any warranties, express or implied.
SpiderOak disclaims all conditions and warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular use, and non-infringement.

(Some states don’t allow these disclaimers, so this provision might not apply to you.) Limitation of Liability 
To the fullest extent allowed by law, SpiderOak shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from (A) your access to, use of, inability to access, or inability to use SpiderOak.
(B) any third-party conduct or content on SpiderOak.
or (C) any unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your content.

(Some states don’t allow these limitations, so this provision might not apply to you.) Arbitration We like to resolve disputes fairly, quickly, and easily.
Toward that end, if you have any issue with SpiderOak, please contact us and we’ll work with you in good faith to try to resolve the matter.
If we can’t work out the problem informally, and if you are a resident of or have your principal place of business in the United States or Canada, you and SpiderOak agree to resolve any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration, including claims against SpiderOak affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, and SpiderOak affiliates’ officers, directors, employees and agents.
You and SpiderOak agree to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution.
The AAA’s rules and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org.
The arbitration will be held in Kansas City, Missouri, or any other location both parties agree to in writing.
Allocation of fees and costs shall be determined under the AAA rules, except that SpiderOak will reimburse you for all AAA administrative fees in disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs all disputes between you and SpiderOak.
The arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.
If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a resident nor have a principal place of business in the United States or Canada, you agree to resolve any claim you have with SpiderOak exclusively in a state or federal court located in Kansas City, Missouri and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts for purpose of litigating all such disputes.
Nothing shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the services. YOUR RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate.
If you do so, neither you nor SpiderOak can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.
To opt out, you must notify SpiderOak within 90 days of the date that you first agreed to these Terms.
Send your written opt-out notice to this address: Arbitration Opt-Out, SpiderOak, Inc., 4741 Central Street # 324, Kansas City, MO 64112.
Your written opt-out notice must include (1) your name and residence address.
(2) the email address and/or mobile telephone number associated with your account.
(3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
and (4) your signature. NO CLASS ACTIONS You may bring disputes only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, except for its conflict of laws principles.
For claims that aren’t subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Kansas City, Missouri or in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri. Entire Agreement These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and SpiderOak.
If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. No Waiver No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be a further or continuing waiver of that term.
SpiderOak’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. Modification The Terms may be modified from time to time.
The date of the most recent revisions will always be at https://spideroak.com/policy/terms-of-use, and older versions will be archived at spideroak.com.
If we make changes that we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will post the revisions 7 days before they take effect so you can review them.
You’ll agree to accept any changes or revisions to the Terms by continuing to use SpiderOak. Contact We welcome all questions, concerns, and feedback you might have about these terms.
