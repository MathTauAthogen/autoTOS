 Welcome to the Oath Privacy Center 
In June 2017, we announced that Yahoo and AOL had joined to become Oath, a digital and mobile media company and part of Verizon.
 We’re now bringing Oath and Yahoo under a single privacy policy.
 Some things haven’t changed, like the control tools we provide to help you manage your experience with us.
 If you have an existing Yahoo or AOL account, you will need to agree to this Privacy Policy.
 If you have not yet agreed to this Privacy Policy, the legacy Yahoo Privacy Policy or legacy Oath Privacy Policy (for AOL) still apply to your account.
 For Oath products or services that are accessed without signing into an account, this Privacy Policy applies to those products and services starting May 25, 2018.  If you are creating a new account, the terms below apply starting today.
 


Last updated: April 2018
 Our Privacy Pledge Our commitment is to put users first.
 We strive to be transparent about how we collect and use your information, to keep your information secure and to provide you meaningful choices.

You agree to pay us for any fee-based Services you purchase from us, as well as all other charges incurred under your account, including applicable taxes and fees.
You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account, including purchases made by you or anyone you allow to use your account or any sub-or linked accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.

Payment Methods.
You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with us, even if we received it in association with other fee-based services.

We may offer you free trials, so that you may try a fee-based Service subscription without charge or obligation ("Free Trial").
Unless otherwise stated and unless you cancel your subscription prior to the expiration of the Free Trial, periodic subscription fees will be charged at the then-applicable rate upon expiration of the Free Trial period and will continue to be charged until the subscription is canceled.

BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE FOR U.S.
USERS.
YOU AND OATH BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CONTROVERSIES OR CLAIMS THAT IN ANY WAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THESE TERMS OR FROM ANY SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH SERVICES), INCLUDING ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS (“DISPUTE(S)”), ONLY BY ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, ARBITRATION OR A SMALL CLAIMS ACTION WILL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US.
YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND OATH ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
WHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.
THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
THEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT.
We also both agree that:


Notice of Dispute. If either you or Oath intends to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration.
Notice to Oath should be sent to Oath either by mail to Oath, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089.
or disputes@oath.com.
Notice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that Oath has in its records at the time the notice is sent.
The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought.
If we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.

Arbitration Procedure. The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms.
Except for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
The AAA will apply the Commercial Arbitration Rules to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions).
You can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA (www.adr.org).
These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.

Small Claims Court Option.
As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.

Arbitration Location. Unless you and Oath agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.

Arbitration Fees and Expenses. We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute.
If you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA.
If the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.

Settlement Offers. We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration.
The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim.
If you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute.
If the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.

Severability.
If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s).
However, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof.
Any Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable.
To avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.




CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S.
USERS.
THESE TERMS DO NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.
ARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.
IN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES.
ANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.



JURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S.
USERS.
IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND OATH AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL.
YOU AND OATH UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS.
IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.


Choice of Law. These Terms and the relationship between the parties, including any claim or dispute that might arise between the parties, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
In no event will the parties bring claims against one another under the laws of another jurisdiction.

Forum.
If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, all such Disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the relationship between you and Oath, will be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of New York, New York or the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York.
In such cases, you and Oath agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of New York, New York or the Southern District of New York, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts.

Modifying the Services.
Modifying these Terms

Where we modify the Services as outlined in Section 7(a), or we modify these Terms pursuant to Section 12(b), we will tell you a reasonable amount of time in advance of any modifications that will materially disadvantage our users or materially limit the access or usage of Services.
Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any such modifications means that you agree to the Services or the Terms as modified.
For modifications to the Terms or to the Services that we need to make to meet security, safety, legal or regulatory requirements, we may not be able to notify you in advance but we will let you know as soon as practicable.



Notice of cancellation, suspension or limitation of the Services or your account.

Despite Subsection (f) above and without prejudice to your statutory rights, we may, without notice, temporarily or permanently suspend or cancel your account or impose limits on or restrict your access to parts or all of your account or the Services: 
if you violate, or we believe you are about to violate, the Terms, including any incorporated agreements, policies or guidelines;
in response to requests by law enforcement or other government agencies under valid legal process;
due to unexpected technical or security issues or problems.
or
if your account shows extended periods of inactivity in accordance with our account deletion policy.




If we permanently suspend or terminate your account, we will notify you in advance and allow you reasonable time to access and save information, files, and content associated with your account unless we have reason to believe that continued access to your account will violate applicable legal provisions, requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, or cause damage to us or to third parties.

If you are a consumer living in the EU, you can cancel your fee-based Service without giving a reason within 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.
You can notify us by contacting us at customer care, or completing and submitting this form.
You must send your notification to us before expiry of the 14 days cancellation period.

Exceptions.
If you purchase digital content not supplied in a tangible medium from us you agree that the cancellation period expires immediately once you begin to download or stream the digital content.

Reimbursement.
We will reimburse all payments received from you for the fee-based Service no later than 14 days from the day on which we received your cancellation notification.
Unless you expressly agree otherwise, we will use the same means of payment as used for the initial transaction.
You agree that if you start using the fee-based Service before the end of the cancellation period you will be liable for all charges incurred up to the date of cancellation
