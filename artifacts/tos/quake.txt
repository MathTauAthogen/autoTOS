GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007


Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.


0.
Additional Definitions.


As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.


"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.


An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.


A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.
The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".


The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.


The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.


1.
Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.


You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.


2.
Conveying Modified Versions.


If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:



a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or


b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.



3.
Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.


The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.
You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:



a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.


b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.



4.
Combined Works.


You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:



a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.


b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.


c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.


d) Do one of the following:



0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.


1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.



e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.
(If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.
If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)



5.
Combined Libraries.


You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:



a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.


b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.



6.
Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.


The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.


Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.


If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

Paid Services


  
 Some Services may be offered by Id Software for free while others require payment of a fee.  You must pay the applicable subscription or other fees to participate in paid Services.  For information about subscription and other fees for particular Services, visit www.quakelive.com.
  

FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART.

  
 When you provide credit card information to Id Software or its payment processing agent, you represent to Id Software that you are the authorized user of the credit card that is used to pay for subscription or other fees and authorize Id Software to charge your credit card for any subscription or other fees incurred by you.  For annual subscriptions or other fees, you agree and reaffirm that, until such authorization is timely cancelled or revoked, Id Software is authorized to charge your credit card for the subscription, subscription renewal or other fee. 
  
 Id Software reserves the right to change fees or billing methods at any time, including charging a fee for Services previously offered free of charge.  For an annual subscription for a Service, Id Software will provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least twenty (20) days in advance by posting such changes on the Website.  You are responsible for reviewing the Website to obtain timely notice of such changes.  Your continued use of the Website and/or any Service twenty (20) days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but Id Software will not refund you any fees that may have accrued to Your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and Id Software will not prorate fees for any subscription.  In addition, you may lose some or all access to certain features, data, or information associated with the paid Services.  If your use of Services is subject to use, sales or other taxes, then Id Software may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees.  For further information, visit www.quakelive.com.
  
 A.     Payment Options.  You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.  Payment methods may vary.  When you provide credit card or other payment information to Id Software or its payment processing agent, you represent to Id Software that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other payment method.  By agreeing to this POLICY, you have agreed to permit Id Software to automatically renew your subscription to the applicable Service by charging a valid credit card number, which you have provided to Id Software or its payment processing agent.  Your subscription will be automatically renewed thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the term and each anniversary thereafter at then then-current price, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless you cancel your subscription.  At the time of payment, you must provide current, complete, and accurate information (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date).  In the absence of a cancellation, you authorize Id Software, or any other company that acts as a billing agent for Id Software, to automatically continue charging that card unless you cancel your subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the subscription and/or to continue to attempt to charge all sums described herein to your credit card account until such amounts are paid in full.  Id Software and its payment processing agent reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to Id Software or its payment processing agent.  Customers who use a payment method other than credit card may incur an additional payment processing fee, and may not be able to automatically renew subscriptions.
  
 B.     Trial Subscriptions. Id Software, in its sole discretion, may choose to offer a free trial subscription to Services that are normally offered for a fee.  You are always responsible for any Internet service provider, telephone, wireless and other connection fees that you may incur when using the Services, even if we offer a free trial subscription.

Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes.
Your continued use of the Website, or accessing Your Account (defined below) following such changes, will signify your acceptance of these changes.



Definition of Personal Information


As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Personal Information” shall mean information that may be used to identify you as the visitor to the Website, such as a name, location, email address, and “player name.”  Where applicable, Personal Information may include your home address, birth date, credit card information, and other personal information as defined under applicable law.  We do not require this information to gain access to the Website.
however, you may not use certain features, products or services that require registration (for example, premium services) unless such information is provided.


Collection of Personal Information


                        Id Software may collect Personal Information when you create a personal account (“Your Account”) with Id Software which you may set up on a different page of the Website.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and log in information applicable to Your Account.
Access to certain Website pages, including certain pages at www.quakelive.com, require a log in and a password and may further require the creation of a personal account, which requires the provision of your name, e-mail and/or other information.  Use of the Website, and the information or programs downloadable from the Website, may be governed by an agreement between Id Software and you as the end user of the Website.
  By registering, you agree that Id Software may process your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use located on another page of this Website and all applicable end user or similar license agreements applicable to the Website, Id Software services and any related software.

When you browse our Website you do so anonymously, unless you have previously registered with us and have logged in.
Id Software uses third party tools to track your anonymous activity on our Website in order to collect information.
This information may conceivably relate to Personal Information.  We also use standard technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, and other HTML tools, to collect information about your use of our Website, personalize your experience on our Website, monitor advertisements and other activities, and to record certain information.
We make extensive use of cookies to provide a user-friendly experience.
A cookie is a small text file containing information that a Website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.
A cookie cannot give us access to your computer or information beyond what you provide to us.
Most web browsers automatically accept cookies.  You should consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies.
If you disable cookies, you can still browse some pages of the Website, however cookies are required to create, activate or login to a personal account on our Website.
If you have registered with us and are logged in, we can track your activity and relate it to the user profile created when you initially register.

Other technologies used include clear GIFs and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address logging.
Clear GIFs (a.k.a.
web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message.
Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or e-mail message.
We do not use clear GIFs to collect Personal Information about you.
However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.
We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on the Website.
Id Software also maintains log files which contain IP addresses.  An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  Id Software uses IP addresses and log files to identify your physical location relative to game servers and in displaying your country flag in connection with your profile within the Website.  We may also use IP addresses to monitor traffic on the Website, report information to our advertisers, and to troubleshoot technical problems.  In the event of user abuse of our Website, we may block certain IP addresses, and IP addresses may be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.

If you choose to use our “Search &amp.
Invite a Friend” service to find a friend on the Website, or to suggest a friend visit the Website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.  We will send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit our Website.  Id Software stores your friend’s name and email address for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking.  We do not keep or use this information for any other purpose.
QUAKE LIVE makes extensive use of advertisement serving technology, which enables advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the Game or Website on your PC, and displayed while you play online or browse the Website.  
Similarly, and to the extent that we use other advertisers, those companies may place cookies on the browsers of visitors to the Website, collect information regarding your activities online, including the sites you visit, and/or log information that is needed to measure presentation of, and serve advertising to the appropriate geographic region, and to the correct location within the game.  Collected data may include IP address or player’s user name, in-game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of advertisement, and angle of view.  You may be assigned an ID number, which may be stored on your PC, and used by other advertisers to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of dynamic web, video and/or in-game advertising.  The ID number is not associated with any personal data, and no logged information is used to personally identify you.  This ad serving technology is integrated into QUAKE LIVE.
if you do not want to use this technology, do not use the Website or play the Game.  For more information about the practices of other large ad serving companies that may collect information based on your interaction with ads on this site and others, or to "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by National Advertising Initiative (NAI) member ad networks, you should visit www.networkadvertising.org.
We may also receive other personal information from third parties in connection with the operation and distribution of our products and services as well as market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.
As with all other information, we use this data only for purposes consistent with this policy.


Non Personal Information

We may also collect other non-personal information such as feature usage, game play statistics, scores and achievements, user rankings and click paths as well as other data that you may provide in surveys, via Your Account preferences and online profiles such as friends lists or purchases, for instance.
We may also receive either non-personal or public information from third parties in connection with market and demographic studies that we use to supplement personal information provided directly by you.  Id Software collects non-personal information along with personal information when you actively provide it in the context of various online activities including online purchases, game registration and marketing surveys, for instance.
In addition, we use cookies and other technologies to passively collect non-personal demographic information, personalize your experience on our sites and monitor advertisements and other activities.
