   Twitter Privacy Policy We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.
We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us.

That’s the basic purpose of this Privacy Policy. You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key things we hope you take away from it: Twitter is public and Tweets are immediately viewable and searchable by anyone around the world.
We give you non-public ways to communicate on Twitter too, through protected Tweets and Direct Messages.
You can also use Twitter under a pseudonym if you prefer not to use your name.
When you use Twitter, even if you’re just looking at Tweets, we receive some personal information from you like the type of device you’re using and your IP address.
You can choose to share additional information with us like your email address, phone number, address book contacts, and a public profile.
We use this information for things like keeping your account secure and showing you more relevant Tweets, people to follow, events, and ads.

   1.1 Basic Account Information You don’t have to create an account to use some of our service features, such as searching and viewing public Twitter profiles or watching a broadcast on Periscope’s website.
If you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you.
On Twitter this includes a display name (for example, “Twitter Moments”), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number.
Your display name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym.
You can also create and manage multiple Twitter accounts, for example to express different parts of your identity.

 Close tooltip   1.2 Public Information Most activity on Twitter is public, including your profile information, your time zone and language, when you created your account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter you Tweeted from.
You also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile.
The lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public.
Periscope broadcasts you create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions.
So are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you’ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay.
Any hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account’s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope.
Information posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public.
For example, other people may tag you in a photo (if your settings allow) or mention you in a Tweet.
You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information.
If you update your public information on Twitter, such as by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android.
In addition to providing your public information to the world directly on Twitter, we also use technology like application programming interfaces (APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter.
We generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access.
We have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms.
But these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter.
For more information about how we make public data on Twitter available to the world, visit https://developer.twitter.com.

We also use contact information to personalize our services, enable certain account features (for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS), and to send you information about our services.
If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Twitter to that number as your country’s laws allow.
Twitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your country’s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.
You can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from Twitter.
You can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.

We also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.
You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your Periscope account to these other services.
If you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address, friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.
You can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.
If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.   1.4 Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content.
For example, you can use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on Periscope.
When you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications and information related to them.
This includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to http://t.co URLs, detection of spam and prohibited images, and review of reported issues.
We also use information about whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content.
We share the content of your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to.
we do not use them to serve you ads.
Note that if you interact in a way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet, those interactions will be public.
When you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.

This helps Twitter to provide you with relevant content.

  Precise location data You can turn on Twitter’s location services, letting Twitter pinpoint your position.
This enables you to use additional features on Twitter, like Tweeting with your precise location.

  Tweet your location You can choose to share your location in a Tweet publicly, letting everyone know you’re at an event, venue, or anywhere else.
    2.2 Links In order to operate our services, we keep track of how you interact with links across our services.
This includes links in emails we send you and links in Tweets that appear on other websites or mobile applications.
If you click on an external link or ad on our services, that advertiser or website operator might figure out that you came from Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach.
They may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.   2.3 Cookies A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.
Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services.
Cookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at public profiles.
Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, many browsers’ settings can be set to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer.
However, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies.
When your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences.

We use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of Twitter.
Our ad partners and affiliates share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, mobile device IDs, hashed email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app.
Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.
Twitter adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”) and respects the DAA’s consumer choice tool for you to opt out of interest-based advertising at https://optout.aboutads.info.
In addition, our ads policies prohibit advertisers from targeting ads based on categories that we consider sensitive or are prohibited by law, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health.
Learn more about your privacy options for interest-based ads here and about how ads work on our services here.
If you are an advertiser or a prospective advertiser, we process your personal data to help offer and provide our advertising services.

Subject to your settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or devices other than those you use to log into Twitter (or associate your logged-out device or browser with other browsers or devices).
