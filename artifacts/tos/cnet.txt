Contact Us 
 Effective Date November 15, 2017 Click to review previous version.
Welcome to the network of interactive services provided by CBS Interactive Inc., its affiliates and its subsidiaries (collectively “CBS Interactive,” “us,” or “we”).  These Terms of Use, along with our Privacy Policy , Mobile Application End User License Agreement, Video Services and Social Networking Policy (collectively “Terms”) govern your use of the websites, applications, and other products and services offered by CBS Interactive or its affiliates that include an authorized link to these Terms (collectively, the “Services”).

Please review these Terms carefully before using the Services because they affect your rights.  By using any of the Services, you accept these Terms and agree to be legally bound by them.

Certain Services are provided to you free of charge, while other Services, including CBS All Access (“All Access”), require payment before you can access them.  If you choose to subscribe to All Access, please review the provisions of Section 8, in addition to all of the other provisions of these Terms.  If you are not a subscriber of All Access, then Section 8 does not apply to you.  References to Services throughout these Terms include All Access.

 Changes These Terms are effective as of the Effective Date above.
If you have not reviewed the Terms of Use applicable to a Service since the Effective Date, please review these updated Terms carefully before using any Service.
We may change these Terms in the future, so we encourage you to review periodically the Terms of Use applicable to each Service you use.
The most current version of the applicable Terms of Use (along with its effective date) will be linked from each of the Services.
If you do not agree with any changes to these Terms, your sole remedy is not to use the Services.
If you continue to use the Services after we change these Terms, you accept all changes.

 Privacy Policy.
Additional Terms Our Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning data that you provide or that we may collect about you through the Services, and you consent to our use of data in compliance with the Privacy Policy.
Additional terms may apply to your use of certain Services.  We will provide these terms to you or post them on the Services to which they apply, and they are incorporated by reference into these Terms.  If there is a conflict between these Terms and any additional terms that apply to a particular Service, the additional terms will control.
Sweepstakes, contests, and promotions on the Services may also have additional rules and eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions.  You are responsible for complying with these rules and requirements.

 Registration and Access Controls If we request registration information from you to set up a user account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information and must update the information when it changes.  You may not access any age-restricted Services unless you are above the required age.  In no case are persons under the age of thirteen permitted to use the Services.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user account login names and passwords, and must not permit use of your account by anyone other than members of your household.  You accept responsibility for all activities, charges, and damages that occur under your account, including use of your account by other members of your household, and unauthorized use of your account.  If you have reason to believe that someone is using your account without your permission, you should contact us immediately.  We are not responsible for any loss or damage resulting from unauthorized use.

 Intellectual Property.
License The audio and video materials, photographs, text, graphics, logos, layouts, designs, interfaces, software, data and other content associated with the Services (“Content”) are protected by intellectual property and other laws in the U.S.
and in other countries.  You must comply with all such laws and applicable copyright, trademark or other legal notices or restrictions.  You shall not remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or other legal notices marked on the Content.  As between you and CBS Interactive, CBS Interactive will retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Services and the Content.  No transfer of ownership to any portion of the Content shall be made as a result of any access you are granted.  Except as specifically provided below, we reserve all rights to the Services and Content.
You are only permitted to access and view the Content for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms, and may not build a business or other enterprise utilizing any of the Content, whether for profit or not.  Except as provided in Section 4(a) or otherwise expressly authorized by us in writing, you may not either directly or through the use of any software, device, internet site, web-based service or other means download, stream capture, store in a database, archive or otherwise copy any part of the Services or Content.
upload, sell, rent, lease, lend, broadcast, transmit or otherwise disseminate, distribute, display or perform any part of the Services or Content.
license or sublicense any part of the Services or Content.
or in any way exploit any part of the Services or Content.  In addition, except as provided in Section 4(a) or otherwise expressly authorized by us in writing, you are strictly prohibited from modifying Content.
creating, distributing or advertising an index of any significant portion of the Content.
or otherwise creating derivative works or materials that otherwise are derived from or based in any way on the Content, including mash-ups and similar videos, montages, translations, desktop themes, fonts, icons, wallpaper, greeting cards, and merchandise.  This prohibition from creating derivative works is applicable even if you intend to give away the derivative material free of charge.
Without limiting the foregoing, you may not modify, interfere with, enhance, remove, or otherwise alter in any way any portion of the CBS Interactive video player (the “Video Player”).
any of the Video Player’s underlying technology.
or any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control measure incorporated into the Video Player.  This restriction includes, without limitation, disabling, modifying, reverse engineering, interfering with or otherwise circumventing the Video Player in any manner that enables users to view Content without:  (i) visibly displaying both the Video Player and all surrounding elements (including the graphical user interface, any advertising, copyright notices, and trademarks) of the webpage where the Video Player is located.
and (ii) having full access to all functionality of the Video Player, including, without limitation, all video quality and display functionality and all interactive, elective or click-through advertising functionality.

Viral Distribution We may expressly authorize you to redistribute certain Content on a personal, non-commercial basis.  We will identify the Content that you are authorized to redistribute and describe ways you may redistribute it (such as via email, blogs, or embedded players, or by producing Mash-Ups).  We may revoke this authorization at any time.  If you redistribute such Content, you must be able to edit or delete such publicly posted Content and you must edit or delete it promptly upon our request.  When expressly authorized by us in writing, you may embed videos using the Video Player, provided you do not embed the Video Player on any website or other location that (i) contains or hosts content that is inappropriate, profane, vulgar, offensive, false, disparaging, defamatory, obscene, illegal, infringing, threatening, sexually explicit, racist, that promotes violence, racial hatred, or terrorism, or that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be otherwise objectionable or (ii) links to infringing or unauthorized content, or any content described in (i).  You may not embed the Video Player into any hardware or software application, even for non-commercial purposes.  As determined by us in our sole discretion, we reserve the right to prevent embedding to any website or other location that we find inappropriate or otherwise objectionable as determined by us in our sole discretion.
Some Services may include “Mash-Up Tools” that allow you to manipulate Content or combine User Submissions (as defined in Section 6) with Content to create “Mash-Ups.”  The following terms apply to your use of Mash-Up Tools, except as specifically provided in other terms accompanying the Mash-Up Tools:

You may only use designated Content with the Mash-Up Tools, and we may revoke permission to use the designated Content at any time.
You may manipulate or combine the designated Content using the Mash-Up Tools only as authorized and only for personal, non-commercial purposes.
As between you and us, we own all compilation rights in the Mash-Ups and may make perpetual and unrestricted use of the Mash-Ups, and you will only retain whatever prior rights you had in your User Submissions.&lt;
With our permission, other users of the Services may make subsequent Mash-Ups using your Mash-Ups.
You must include any required or existing trademark, copyright or other legal notices in the Mash-Ups and you must comply with any other usage or attribution guidelines we provide.
If we expressly allow you to do so, you may distribute Mash-Ups under the Viral Distribution guidelines above in Section 4(a) of these Terms.


 Commercial Licenses You must obtain our written permission for commercial use of the Content or the Services.  If you wish to license Content from the Services, please contact us.



 Legal Complaints CBS Interactive respects intellectual property rights.  If you believe that Content on the Services infringes your copyright, please follow our procedures for making a copyright infringement claim.  If you have a legal complaint other than a copyright claim, please follow our procedure for making other legal complaints.

 User Submissions Some of the Services may allow you to submit or transmit audio, video, text, or other materials, including so-called “user generated content” and “feedback” (collectively, “User Submissions”) to or through the Services.  When you provide User Submissions, you grant to CBS Interactive and its affiliates and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully sublicenseable license to use, reproduce, archive, edit, translate, create derivative works of, make available, distribute, sell, display, perform, transmit, broadcast and in any other way exploit those User Submissions, and any names, voices, likenesses and other identifying information of persons that is part of those User Submissions, in any form, media, software, or technology of any kind now known or developed in the future, including, without limitation, for developing, manufacturing, and marketing products.  You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in your User Submissions.
We respect your ownership of User Submissions.  If you owned a User Submission before providing it to us, you will continue owning it after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in these Terms and any access granted to others.  Please note that if you delete a User Submission from the Services:

The User Submission may still exist in our backup copies, which are not publicly available.
If your User Submission was shared with third parties, those third parties may have retained copies of your User Submissions, and neither we nor our affiliates have any responsibility for any uses of your User Submission that they might make.
We retain the license specified above.  Thus, for example, if we or one of our sublicensees obtained your user Submission for use in creating a derivative work before you deleted it, we or our sublicensee would remain free to complete the creation of that derivative work and thereafter exploit that derivative work for all purposes and at all times.

We may refuse or remove a User Submission without notice to you.  However, we have no obligation to monitor User Submissions, and you agree that neither we nor our affiliates will be liable for User Submissions or any loss or damage resulting from User Submissions.
Except as provided in the Privacy Policy, we do not guarantee that User Submissions will be private, even if the User Submission is in a password-protected area.  Accordingly, you should not provide User Submissions that you want protected from others.
You bear all responsibility for your User Submissions.  You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant to CBS Interactive the license above and that your User Submissions do not violate Section 11.

 Third-Party Content We may provide third party content (including advertisements) or link to third party websites on the Services.  We do not necessarily endorse or evaluate third party content and websites, and we do not assume responsibility for third parties’ actions or omissions.  You should review third parties’ terms of use and privacy policies before you use their services.  In certain instances, you may be able to connect and/or link your account to certain third party social media sites ("Social Media Sites"), including, without limitation, Facebook and Twitter.  BY CONNECTING OR LINKING YOUR ACCOUNT TO ANY SOCIAL MEDIA SITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE CONTINUOUS RELEASE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO OTHERS, INCLUDING TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE (IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR PRIVACY SETTINGS ON SUCH SOCIAL MEDIA SITE).  IF YOU DO NOT WANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU TO BE SHARED IN THIS MANNER, DO NOT CONNECT OR LINK YOUR ACCOUNT TO ANY SOCIAL MEDIA SITE.  Please see our Video Services and Social Networking Policy for additional information.

 All Access Subscriptions and Billing This Section 8 contains additional provisions that apply if you subscribe to All Access.

8.1    All Access Account Information.  You can access and edit specific details regarding your subscription to All Access, including information concerning your credit card or other available payment method (“Payment Method”), on the CBS.com website at any time by clicking on your name, which appears at the top of each page of the site when you are logged in, and then following the link to your All Access account.

8.2    Age Limitations.  Individuals under the age of 18 may utilize All Access only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian.  You acknowledge that by using All Access, you may be exposed to Content that you find objectionable, and it is your sole responsibility to determine whether the Content in All Access is suitable for you.  Some Content may not be suitable for people under the age of 18.

8.3    Supported Devices.  To see if All Access is available for your device click here.

8.4    Payment.  By providing Payment Method information for your All Access subscription, you are agreeing to pay a monthly or annual subscription fee, as applicable, and any applicable taxes and service fees (“Fees”) in connection with your use of All Access.
The Fees will be charged to your Payment Method automatically at the beginning of your subscription (or, as described in Section 8.9, at the end of your Trial Period, where applicable), and at the beginning of each subscription period renewal thereafter on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your subscription unless you cancel your subscription or your account or All Access is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms.
If your monthly subscription begins after the 28th day of a month, then in any subsequent month in which that day does not occur, CBS Interactive will charge your Payment Method on approximately the last day of such month.
For example, if you started your monthly subscription on January 31st, your next payment date will be approximately February 28th.
The Fees charged to your Payment Method may vary from month to month or year-to-year due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize CBS Interactive to charge your Payment Method for these amounts.
CBS Interactive reserves the right to change the pricing of All Access at any time.
In the event of a price change, CBS Interactive will post the new pricing in All Access and attempt to notify you in advance by sending an email to the address you have registered for your account.
If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your All Access subscription as described in Section 8.6.

YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES.

8.5    No Refunds.  ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.
As described further in Section 8.6, even if you cancel All Access during a monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable, you will not receive a refund for any portion of the Fees for the remainder of that monthly or annual subscription period.
In rare circumstances, we may provide a credit, refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our subscribers (“Credits”).
The amount and form of such Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole discretion.
The provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide Credits in the future, under any circumstance.

8.6    Cancellation.  You can cancel your subscription to CBS All Access at any time by contacting us at (888)274-5343, Monday to Sunday 8 am to midnight EST, or by logging into your account at https://www.cbs.com/all-access/account/ and clicking "cancel subscription." If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of the then-current monthly or annual subscription period, as applicable.
You will have continued access to All Access for the remainder of your paid subscription period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID.

or any other All Access policies or practices.

8.7    Unpaid Amounts.  If you fail to pay any Fees when due, as a result of expiration of your Payment Method, insufficient funds, or otherwise, (1) you will remain liable for all such amounts, as well as any costs that CBS Interactive incurs in collecting any amounts you fail to pay in connection with All Access, including attorney and collections fees.
(2) you authorize CBS Interactive to continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated as described in Section 8.1.
and (3) we may suspend or terminate your subscription.
Changing your Payment Method information may affect the day of your subscription renewal.

8.8    Promo Codes.  From time to time, promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion.  Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion.  Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may not be combined with other offers, subject to certain restrictions as determined by CBS Interactive in its sole discretion.  If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.

8.9.    Trial Period.  CBS Interactive may provide a limited free trial period (“Trial Period”) to new users and certain former subscribers at its sole discretion, but is under no obligation to do so, and Trial Periods may not be available at all times.  CBS Interactive reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period.  The specific terms of the Trial Period will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular Trial Period.  If CBS Interactive provides you with a Trial Period, you must provide valid Payment Method information to CBS Interactive in order to use All Access during the Trial Period.  CBS Interactive will not charge you in connection with the Trial Period.  CBS Interactive may place a temporary charge in a nominal amount on your Payment Method to ensure the validity of the Payment Method, but the temporary charge will be removed promptly.

on a Monday in your time zone, and your Trial Period is 2 days, you have until 3:00 p.m.
on Wednesday in your time zone to cancel your subscription before your paying subscription will begin.  You may only have one Trial Period before you must begin paying for All Access.  If you exceed this limit, CBS Interactive may charge your Payment Method for any Trial Period after the first, or suspend your use of All Access, in its sole discretion.

8.10    Maximum Streams.  You may only use a maximum of two simultaneous streams (measured across all Content available on All Access) at any time regardless of the number of devices that CBS Interactive permits you to use with All Access.  CBS Interactive may change the maximum number of simultaneous streams of All Access that you may use at any time in its sole discretion.

8.11    Broadcast and Territory Restrictions.  All Access is only available to US-based users.  You may only use All Access and its Content in the United States and for your own personal, non-commercial purposes.  Certain features and Content may only be available to users in certain locations, during certain periods, and on certain devices, and the availability of certain features and Content may change over time.
Please check the All Access FAQ for more information about current limitations.  In the case of geographic limitations, your location may not be identified accurately by the technology used for All Access, so you may be unable to access certain features and Content even if you are located in an area in which we intend to provide access.  You consent to CBS Interactive and its third party providers determining your location for purposes of providing All Access.  CBS Interactive will not be liable to you for any blackouts, location-based limitations, device-based limitations, Content-viewing windows, changes in CBS affiliate stations, availability of Content, or other restrictions or limitations in connection with All Access or the Content.

8.12    Quality of Service.  The quality of the display of the streaming Content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, including your location and the speed of your Internet connection.  The time it takes to begin watching Content will also vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time and the configuration of your device.  CBS Interactive makes no representations or warranties about the quality of your watching experience on your device.

8.13    Updates and Testing.  CBS Interactive reserves the right to update and change All Access, including its features and the selection of Content available in All Access, at any time.  In addition, CBS Interactive reserves the right to test various aspects of All Access.  CBS Interactive reserve the right to, and by using our Services you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice.

8.14    All Access-specific Emails.  As part of All Access, CBS Interactive may send you emails regarding the Content or All Access from time to time.  You agree that CBS Interactive may send you these types of emails to the email address that you provide.  Because these emails are necessary for you to receive All Access, you agree that you will receive these emails even if you have opted out of receiving other email from CBS Interactive.  If you do not want to receive these types of emails, you may cancel All Access at any time as provided in Section 8.6.

8.15.
Subscriptions Obtained Through Third Parties. If you obtain an All Access subscription through a third party distributor that maintains your subscriber account and collects your payments for All Access, that subscription is subject to the distributor’s terms, and the provisions of this Section 8 concerning subscriptions, billing and payment do not apply to that subscription.
When you access All Access through a portal provided by such a third-party distributor, and the distributor transmits All Access Content to you, the provisions of this Section 8 concerning access to and delivery of All Access do not necessarily apply, and in the event of a conflict, the distributor’s applicable terms govern.

8.16.

Unless otherwise stated, all fees and charges are non-refundable, including for unused portions of cancelled subscriptions.  We do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.
CBS Interactive reserves the right to change the pricing of all Services at any time.  In the event of a price change, CBS Interactive will post the new pricing on the relevant Service and attempt to notify you by sending an email to the address you have registered.  Billing for all mobile subscription services will be governed by the Mobile_Features section of these Terms (Section 10) unless the terms of the subscription say otherwise.
We may offer trial subscriptions to paid Services for free or at special discounted prices.  Unless otherwise stated, these trial subscriptions will automatically become paying subscriptions at the current subscription rate if you do not cancel before the end of the trial period.

 Mobile Features In addition to the general terms applicable to the Services, the following terms apply to Services designed for wireless devices (“Mobile Features”), which we offer only to users who are 18 years of age or older and located in the fifty U.S.
states or the District of Columbia unless otherwise noted.

Your wireless provider may charge for use of Mobile Features, including fees for receipt of text messages or data transmission.  In order to receive Mobile Features, your wireless provider may require you to subscribe to additional services, which may require additional fees.  These fees are not charged by us, and you should contact your wireless provider before you sign up for Mobile Features to determine what fees, if any, will be charged.  In addition, you agree that we may arrange for Mobile Features billing through your wireless provider and that your wireless provider may invoice you for the applicable fees or deduct them from your pre-paid balance.

You may not transfer or copy any Content from the wireless device on which you originally received Content to any other device, including, without limitation, any computer or another wireless device.
To cancel a Mobile Feature that involves a subscription fee, you must follow the instructions included in the terms and conditions applicable to that Mobile Feature.
