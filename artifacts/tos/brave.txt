Advertiser Privacy
When you establish an advertiser account with us, we will ask you for the information we need to validate your identity and to bill you for advertising services.
This always includes:

your name, email address, and phone number;
your business’s name and mailing address;
the domain name(s) to which your ads will direct people who see them.
and
billing information needed to process payment.

Other information may be required by your advertising account representative in order to process and fulfill your orders.
The only information we collect from you is the information you provide us in these communications with your account representative.
We need this information in order to operate the advertising services you’re purchasing from us according to the&nbsp;Brave Rewards: Terms of Service for Advertisers contract.
This same information is required in order for us to maintain accurate records and accounts of the services we have provided, in which we have a legitimate interest.
We keep all this info as long as you have an advertiser account with us, and for seven years afterwards.
Beyond seven years, we no longer store your personal information, only information about your company.
We may share your Account Information as follows:

with vendors, consultants and other service providers who act as data processors on behalf of Brave;
in response to a request for information if we believe the disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation or legal process.
or
otherwise, with your consent or at your direction.

We may also share information which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
We may use SendGrid or MailChimp to contact you by email.
This is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU.
Every email we send like this includes an unsubscribe link.

If you believe in good faith that any Content made available in connection with the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the Content be removed, or access to it blocked as set forth below (see https://www.copyright.gov/&nbsp;for further details).
It is Brave’s policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users.
and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.
The address of Brave’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (“Designated Agent”) is listed at the end of this policy.

A.
Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements: If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Brave Service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below: 1.
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.
2.
Identification of works or materials being infringed.
3.
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Brave is capable of finding and verifying its existence.
4.
Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address.
5.
A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and 6.
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

B.
Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent: It is Brave’s policy: 1.
to remove or disable access to the infringing material.
2.
to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material.
and 3.
that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Brave will terminate such content provider’s, member’s or user’s access to the service.

C.
Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent: If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below: 1.
A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user.
2.
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.
3.
A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material.
and 4.
Content provider’s, member’s or user’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located, or if the content provider’s, member’s or user’s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Brave is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Brave’s may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Brave may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.
Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Brave’s discretion.

Notices and counter notices with respect to the Service should be sent to Brave at:

To learn how we use data for the Brave Browser, see the Brave Browser Privacy Policy.
To learn how we use data for publishers and creators, see the Publisher Privacy Policy.
Infrastructure
Brave websites are hosted on infrastructure we operate, and on infrastructure operated on our behalf by Amazon, Heroku (a Salesforce company), and Fastly.
Fastly’s infrastructure is designed to be as close to you as possible — probably in the same country as you, though this is not guaranteed.
The rest of this infrastructure is located in the United States, which is where information is processed and stored.
Amazon, Heroku, and Fastly are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU.
See data processing details.
Community forums
Community.brave.com and forum.batcommunity.org are forums on which you may post and publicly communicate with other Brave users and community-members.
Brave runs these forums, and they are hosted on its behalf by Civilized Discourse Construction Kit.
Their privacy policy describes how they use your data to host the forum for us.
The IP address of all server requests are stored for no more than 30 days.
We have access to the information that you make available on the forum, and can use this to administer the forum.
Information about how Discourse keeps your data safe is available here.
All of Discourse’s code is open source and subject to public inspection.
If you are a user you can access or delete your account (and related data) in the “preferences” panel at community.brave.com.
You can also contact us to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.
See data processing details.
E-mail
If you ask us to keep in touch with you by email about policy issues, we will use MailChimp to do so.
This is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU.
Every email we send like this includes an unsubscribe link.
See data processing details.

Children under the age of 131 are not permitted to use the website, sign up for email updates, join the community forum, or send Brave any other information.
If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has interacted with the website, please contact privacy@brave.com.
In that case, we will do our best to remove all related records.

This policy uses the lowest age for consistency.
The Domain Name Systems (DNS) translates domain names such as Brave.com in to the IP addresses that web browsers use.
Cloudflare is our DNS provider.

Content Creators privacy policy Read this document to learn how we use data for publishers and content creators.
In this policy “we”, “us”, etc.
refers to Brave Software Inc.
(To learn how we use data to operate this website and other Brave sites, forums, and communications, see https://brave.com/website-privacy.
To learn how we use data for the Brave Browser, see https://brave.com/privacy).
Basic Attention Token Tips
If you are a creator who has a YouTube or Twitch account, or owns a website, Brave has a function that allows you to automatically receive gifts of BAT from Brave itself, and from your visitors.
Brave tallies BAT donations to each website and channel (i.e.
YouTube channel, Twitch channel, etc.) anonymously.
Contributions to creators that have not signed up with Brave will be reserved on the device.
No data about these creators or the attention spent on their sites will be transmitted to us at Brave.
The data and all of the logic surrounding it will be entirely“client-side” (i.e.
on the device only).
To collect Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) you must create a Brave Rewards account on this site.
This involves entering your name, email address, and phone number.
It is also necessary to demonstrate that you are the owner of the site(s) or channel(s) for which you receive BAT.
This is done by providing information from your web server or DNS provider.
We may authenticate your credentials with the site that hosts your channel.
Before you can redeem BAT you will have to connect your Brave Rewards account to Uphold, a payments service.
Uphold will then tell us whether your account is in good standing, the list of currencies you have configured, and your preferred currency.

Security

Brave Browser Privacy Policy Brave is a private browser
The Brave browser is designed to not know who you are, or what sites you visit.&nbsp.
Our company does not store any record of people’s browsing history.
We don’t write any personal data to the blockchain.
The only way a user’s data is stored by Brave is if the user has switched on&nbsp;Rewards or&nbsp;Sync. Read this document to understand how the Brave Browser uses data.

To learn how we use data to operate our websites, forums, and communications, visit the Website Privacy Policy.
To learn how we use data for publishers and creators visit the Publisher Privacy Policy on the Basic Attention Token website.
In this policy “we”, “us”, etc.
refers to Brave Software Inc, while “Brave” refers to the browser.
Security &amp.
updates
Brave automatically checks with us for updates.
This ensures that you always have access to the latest security fixes.
We count the number and type of these requests when we receive them to produce aggregate statistics.
No particular person’s information can be identified in the statistics we produce.
You can also update to the latest version here.
Sync
If you switch on Sync then your bookmarks and passwords will be saved in an encrypted file on a cloud storage service, to which you will have the only decryption key.
The data1 are entirely inaccessible to Brave and to the cloud storage provider.
Learn how to switch on Sync here.
(Note that only Brave version 0.59 and above have the Sync feature.
You can update to the latest version here.)
Brave Rewards
If you switch on Brave Rewards you are assigned a “wallet” identifier by Uphold, our payments partner.
We record this identifier on servers operated by Amazon and Heroku (a Salesforce company) in the United States.
These services are operated in the United States, and are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU.
Brave uses your wallet identifier to determine when to send you a monthly gift of attention tokens (BAT).
You can disable this in Preferences or Settings.


Tip: you can quickly access settings by copying 
brave://rewards
 in to your address bar.
Learn how Brave Rewards works here.

Each time Brave sends users a monthly gift of BAT it makes a record of their IP addresses that can be analysed to safeguard against fraud.&nbsp;Brave checks to see whether we are currently offering tokens to Brave users.
This request includes the identifier of your unique Rewards wallet.
See data processing detail.
Even with Brave Rewards enabled, we never collect your browsing history or similar information, and we can’t derive this information from your contributions to content creators and sites.
Instead, we aggregate contributions among all Brave users, and we cannot trace contributions to individual users, or link any of your contributions together.
Ads*
If you switch on Brave Rewards and switch on ads (in Rewards settings) you will see ad notifications, and will receive BAT to reward you for viewing these ads.
While the ads you see are based on your interests, which are inferred from your browsing, Brave Ads is private and anonymous.
The data are stored on your device, and are entirely inaccessible to Brave.
No personal data or browsing history ever leaves the Brave browser on your device.
*Currently only the Dev version&nbsp;has a (limited) version of the Ads feature.
Crash reports
When Brave crashes, it creates a report that can be sent to us to help us fix whatever caused the problem.
This report contains technical information about your computer system which is typically distinctive.
You can choose whether to send us these reports.
Even if you have chosen to send reports in the past, you can turn off future reports in settings.
Nightly, Dev, and Beta browser versions
Nightly, Dev, and Beta versions of the Brave Browser are experimental previews of new Brave Browser versions.
They allow users to test new features, and help Brave to find and fix errors before releasing a new version of the Brave Browser.
These test versions of the Browser may automatically send crash reports to Brave so that we can identify and fix problems.
A crash report can contain personal information.
See data processing details.

How to switch this feature off.
You can switch off “Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Brave Software” in Brave Dev or Brave Beta settings.


Tip:&nbsp;you can quickly access settings by copying 
brave://settings/syncSetup
&nbsp;in to your address bar.

Necessary for the performance of a contract between us (and necessary for us to provide the requested service).
The duration of the user’s account, plus 4 years in order to comply with US Internal Revenue Service requirements.
Browser testing and research (Nightly, Dev, and Beta versions only) Purpose of processing
Categories of personal data processed

Contacting Brave about your privacy
We are always interested in hearing and responding to questions and concerns at twitter.com/brave and at github.com/brave.
More in-depth conversations can be had at community.brave.com.
You can contact our data protection officer, Dr Johnny Ryan, and the rest of our privacy team at privacy@brave.com.

If you’re in the European Union, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority (though everyone should have this right).
We’ll update this policy whenever we make material changes to our practices, and we’ll announce it to let you know.
We hope you’ll find any changes agreeable, but if you’re not comfortable with changes to the info we collect or how we use it, we understand your choice to stop using Brave.&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Notes&nbsp;


Data are personal if the data can single a person out (on their own or in combination with other data), without an unlikely degree of effort or expense or technological development.
The GDPR definition of “personal data” includes any data that can indirectly contribute to singling out an individual, including unique IDs codes, certain types of IP addresses, and encrypted data that one can decrypt without disproportionate effort.
But data that are entirely impossible to access are not personal.
