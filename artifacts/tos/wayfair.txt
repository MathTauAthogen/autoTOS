We care about our customers and know that your privacy is important to you. This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is our way of sharing how we collect your information, why we need it, and how we use it.
Scope of Application
This Privacy Policy applies to your use of our websites and mobile websites (together, the "Site") and our mobile applications (together, the "App," and together with the Site, the "Service"). The Service includes websites and mobile applications operated by Wayfair LLC and its affiliated brands, including Wayfair.com, Joss & Main, AllModern, Birch Lane and Perigold ("Wayfair", "we" or "us"). If you visit another website or mobile application, including another Wayfair website or mobile application, the privacy policy of that website or mobile application will apply. Please review the privacy policy of that website or mobile application to understand how that website or mobile application operator processes your information.
This Privacy Policy also applies to the information you provide to us after being presented with or directed to this Privacy Policy. This could be, for example, when you share your information with our service representatives (e.g. a customer service agent, design professional, or an installation or assembly pro) or send us a letter, email or chat.
Before submitting information to the Service, please review this Privacy Policy carefully.

If you chose to apply for a financing product offered by a financing provider, we collect some of your financing information on behalf of that provider. Once you have completed the application form, we send the data to the financing provider and delete it immediately from our systems, except for information we need to keep in order to provide services to you. We will not use your financing information for any other purpose.
Our Cookie Policy
We use cookies when you visit our Site and App to analyze traffic, optimize performance and content and to provide an integrated and more personalized shopping experience for customers. Cookies are small text files that are stored by your Internet browser on your computer. While our cookies may change from time to time, we generally use the following types of cookies:
Functionality cookies, which allow you to navigate the site and use our features.
Analytics cookies, which allow us to measure, analyze and understand how our customers use the Site and to identify ways to improve both its functionality and your shopping experience. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us evaluate your use of the Site, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services” located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.
Customer preference cookies, which help us remember your preferences (like your language or location) and make your experience more personalized to you.
Targeting or advertising cookies, which allow us to deliver digital ads relevant to you. These types of cookies also limit the number of times that you see an ad and help us measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We use cookies to help us identify and retarget users who may be interested in our products, services or offerings both on our Site and on third party websites. For example, we use proprietary technology to specifically target users by creating advertising material based on the users' previous behavior. To disable interest-based ads, please see Direct Marketing and Behavioral Advertising below.
You can prevent the use of cookies by changing the settings in your web browser so that (i) it does not accept new cookies, (ii) it informs you about new cookies, or (iii) it deletes all already received cookies. By deleting or disabling future cookies, your user experience may be affected and you might not be able to take advantage of certain functions of our Site (such as storing items in your Cart between visits, customizing your website experience, and making marketing messages more relevant).

We also use web beacons to help us identify your computer and evaluate user behavior, such as reactions to promotions. Web beacons are small GIF files that can be embedded in other graphics, emails, or similar. To prevent web beacons on our site, you can use tools such as AdBlock Plus. To prevent web beacons in emails, please set your mail program so that no HTML is displayed in messages.

Direct Marketing and Behavioral Advertising
We may directly send you marketing communications and materials by email, postal mail and other channels to keep you informed of new products, promotions, and to provide other information we think may be of interest to you. You can stop receiving direct marketing messages from us at any time through your preferences here or by clicking any "unsubscribe" link in any marketing message you receive from us. Please note that it may take up to 48 hours to process your request and update our systems. Note that if you request that we stop sending you marketing messages, we will continue to send you administrative and service communications (such as order updates and other important or transactional information).

Please note that if you use more than one name or email address when communicating with Wayfair or using the Site of App, you may continue to receive communications from us to any name or email address not specified in your opt-out request.

We may also display tailored interest-based advertising on both Wayfair-owned and operated sites and unaffiliated sites. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as purchasing on our sites, visiting sites that contain Wayfair content or ads, interacting with Wayfair tools, or using our payment services. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook's Custom Audience service.

We offer you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can opt-out of certain interest-based ads that use our cookies by clicking here. You can also opt-out of receiving some third-party interest-based ads, or learn more about behavioral advertising, by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices or www.networkadvertising.org/choices. Please note that if you opt out of behavioral advertising, you will still see advertisements - they will just not be tailored to your interests. Also note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.

Blogs, Reviews and Forums
The Service also may from time to time offer publicly-accessible blogs, reviews or forums. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected and used by others who access them. To request removal of your information from blogs, customer reviews or forums, please contact us here. Please note that in some cases we may be unable to remove your information.
Our Security Measures
The security of your information is important to us. We use appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized use, disclosure, and loss. Encryption technology, including current industry-standard encryption protocols, is used to protect personal information in certain areas of our websites during transmission across the Internet. We use a PCI-compliant payment service provider over a secured network. If you have questions about the security of your information, please contact us here.
We encourage you to take reasonable measures to protect your password and your computer to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window if you are using a shared computer in a public place such as a library or an Internet cafe.
Keeping Your Information
We will keep your information for as long as you have an account or as long as we need it to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected or disclosed to you at the time of collection. We may also keep some of your information as required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud or abuse, enforce our Terms of Use, or for other permissible purposes.

When we no longer have a need to keep your information, we will either delete it from our systems or anonymize it so that it no longer identifies you.

Children's Privacy
The Site, App and Service are not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that we have information about your child, please contact us here. To learn more about how to protect your child online, visit the FTC’s www.OnGuardOnline.gov.

Order Acceptance
The receipt of an order number or an email order confirmation does not constitute the acceptance of an order or a confirmation of an offer to sell. Wayfair reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item and/or to refuse service to any customer. Verification of information may be required prior to the acceptance of an order. Prices and availability of products on the Sites are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected when discovered and Wayfair reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any error, inaccuracy, or omission (including after an order has been submitted). Certain orders constitute improper use of the Sites and the Wayfair Rewards Program described below. Wayfair reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at Wayfair's sole discretion. Items purchased pursuant to a quantity discount may be re-priced upon cancellation.
About Our Prices
Where a product listing on our Site references a higher price, typically denoted by a strikethrough (e.g. "$549"), such higher price represents the retail price suggested by the manufacturer or supplier. In the absence of a price suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, this price represents the highest price at which we offered or sold the product at some point in the past. For “Flash Deals”, where a product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price, an additional strikethrough price is presented that represents a recent previous price before the Flash Deal promotion. For members of the MyWay Program, if such higher price is accompanied by the MyWay logo, such price represents the offer price before applying MyWay Program benefits. The "Sale" tag on a product listing on our Site signifies that we are selling the product at a discount from a price in the previous 90 days. The Wayfair's Choice badge represents a shortlist of highly-rated, well-priced products we know customers love.
When we use the term “Closeout,” we mean either that the product has been permanently reduced and will not return to the original price or that the product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price in order to clear an overstock of either Wayfair or supplier inventory. Prices of products listed on our Site as “Closeout” may fluctuate during the “Closeout” promotion period for such products. For temporary “Closeout” pricing, such products may return to prices that are equal to or greater than their original prices upon expiration of the applicable “Closeout” promotion period.
We do not price match. Promotional codes can only be applied during purchase. Customer Service will be unable to honor any promotional code adjustments post-order.
Wayfair Rewards Program
The Wayfair Rewards Program (the "Rewards Program") is exclusively for users of the Sites who have registered for the Rewards Program in accordance with the directions set forth below and on the Sites. Rewards Dollars may be applied to future purchases at the Participating Sites in accordance with these Terms of Use. Please click here for complete Rewards Program details, as may be in effect from time to time and which are incorporated herein by reference.
Links to Other Websites
The Sites may contain links to third-party websites ("Other Sites") that are not under Wayfair's control. Wayfair makes no claim and accepts no responsibility regarding the quality, nature or reliability of the Other Sites that are accessible by hyperlinks from the Sites or link to the Sites. Wayfair provides these links to you as a convenience and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Wayfair of Other Sites or any association with the operators of such Other Sites. You are responsible for viewing and abiding by the privacy statements and terms of use posted at any third-party sites.

If you use a mobile device to access pages of the Sites optimized for mobile-viewing, opt in to receive SMS (text messages) from Wayfair (as/when available), or use a mobile application, the following additional terms and conditions ("Mobile Terms") also apply to you.

You understand that wireless through Wi-Fi or a participating mobile service provider may not be available in all areas at all times and may be affected by product, software, coverage or other service changes made by your mobile service provider or otherwise. Additional terms and conditions may apply to your use of a mobile application, based on the type of mobile device on which you install and use the mobile application.
Notice to California Residents
California Proposition 65 requires that special warnings be provided when products contain chemicals known by the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm if the use of those products may cause exposure to those chemicals above specific limits. These warnings relate to some but not all tools, lead crystal glassware, ceramic tableware, tiffany style lamps, and electrical cords. Please call us prior to ordering if you have any questions regarding the safety of these products.
Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1789.3, Wayfair provides users of the Sites with the following notice: You may report complaints to the Consumer Information Division of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at 800-952-5210.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or conditions so such disclaimers may not apply to you.
Limitation on Liability
IN NO EVENT WILL WAYFAIR OR ITS OFFICERS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS, AFFILIATES OR THIRD PARTIES PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THIS SITE OR VIA OTHER CHANNELS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PHONE AND EMAIL, BE LIABLE TO ANY USER OF THE SITES OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF USE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES OR ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN, INCLUDING USER CONTENT, WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WAYFAIR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.
You hereby acknowledge that the preceding limitation on liability will apply to all content, merchandise and services available through the Sites or other channels. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if Wayfair is found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the amount in dispute not to exceed the total amount which you paid to us in the twelve (12) months prior to the action giving rise to the liability or (b) USD $100.
Legal Disputes
YOU AND WAYFAIR AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
Any dispute between you and Wayfair, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, 'Wayfair') arising from or relating to these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms of Use, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Wayfair will provide such notice by email to your e-mail address on file with Wayfair and you must provide such notice by email to legal@wayfair.com.
During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will conduct any arbitration proceedings by telephone or videoconference unless in-person appearances are requested by you or Wayfair and approved by the arbitrator. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location mutually agreed upon by you and Wayfair, or, in the absence of such agreement, at a location determined by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Wayfair and you agree that any Covered Dispute hereunder will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Wayfair nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Home Services
Last Updated: April 9, 2020

Assembly, installation, and professional services you purchase through the Sites are referred to herein as "Home Services" Home Services are provided by independent third-party service providers ("Pros"). The Pros are independent contractors and not employees of Wayfair. Wayfair does not provide the Home Services itself. Wayfair sometimes arranges for the provision of Home Services with Pros directly, and sometimes through other parties that contract with Pros ("Partners"), such as Handy and Go Configure. Wayfair may refer customer service requests regarding Home Services to the Partners. Wayfair makes no guarantee that it will be able to match you with a Pro. Scheduled Home Services dates and times are subject to change. Home Services will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner.
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, WAYFAIR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE HOME SERVICES OR THE PROS.

Wayfair arranges for background checks on the Pros through third-party background check providers, or obtains contractual guarantees from Partners that Pros have been background checked. Regardless, you should exercise caution and common sense when interacting with Pros to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with any person you do not know. You are responsible for verifying the identity of the Pro upon arrival. You are responsible for ensuring that the location where the Home Services are to be performed is safe and secure and that the Pro has free and clear access to such location.

You must be 18 years of age or older to purchase Home Services. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your decisions relating to the Home Services. Either you or someone else 18 years of age or older authorized by you must be present at all times during the performance of the Home Services. You are responsible for inspecting the Home Services and signing any relevant forms. If you are not present during performance, the adult present must be authorized by you to inspect the Home Services and sign any required forms on your behalf. You agree that products assembled, installed or otherwise worked on or with by Pros (collectively, "Products") are for home use only and not for commercial applications or use. You are responsible for designating the location where Pros assemble, install, and otherwise work on or with the Products. Wayfair, the Partners, and the Pros make no recommendation, representation, or warranty regarding the use or location of the Products, including the surface on which they are installed. You have not relied on any statement made by any of the foregoing parties in determining the use or location of the Products. You are responsible for obtaining any required approvals, permissions, permits, and variances necessary related to the Home Services. You assume all risk, including any risk of relocation or removal, arising from the use or location of the Products. You will follow all instructions and warnings relating to the Products and will ensure that all persons who use the Products do the same.

You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Wayfair, the Partners, and the Pros, and each of their owners, affiliates, parents, subsidiaries, successors, assigns, officers, directors, agents, employees, attorneys, insurers, and representatives (each an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action, proceedings, losses, injury, damages, expenses, fines, penalties, and costs arising from or in connection with (i) the use and/or location of the Products; and (ii) your breach or violation of this Home Services Section. You hereby waive, release, covenant not to sue, and forever discharge each Indemnified Party from any and all debts, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, covenants, contracts, agreements, promises, torts, damages, claims, demands, losses, and liabilities whatsoever of any name and nature, both in law and in equity, which you now have, ever had, or may in the future have against any Indemnified Party arising from or in connection with (i) the use and/or location of the Products; and (ii) your breach or violation of, or failure to abide by, this Home Services Section.

Wayfair Card Benefits Program
The Wayfair Card Benefits Program is designed to reward customers for making purchases on their Wayfair Card. Refer to the Program Terms for eligibility requirements for the Wayfair Card Benefits Program and for other applicable terms. Terms used but not defined herein will have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Program Terms.
Eligible Wayfair Card cardholders have the ability to earn Points on Net New Purchases made on the Wayfair Card that can be redeemed for Rewards Dollars later. Certain products may be ineligible for earning points.
"Net New Purchases" means purchases of goods and/or services at the Sites made by you or any Authorized User on your Account minus any returns, refunds, discounts by using Rewards Dollars, credit adjustments, or promotions, rounded to the nearest dollar. Points awarded for purchases that are returned or refunded or otherwise adjusted will be deducted from your Point total. Such deductions may result in a negative Points balance, in which case, any Points you earn will be applied to reduce that balance and you will not be able to redeem Points until you again have a positive balance. Points will not be awarded for the Rewards Dollars you redeem.
Wayfair reserves the right to increase or decrease the amount of Points earned on Net New Purchases at any time. We may from time to time make special offers for you to earn additional Points on specific purchases. The terms and conditions for such special offers (such as which purchases qualify and the number of additional Points you may earn) will be disclosed at the time of offer. Please check those terms and conditions carefully, as there may be important conditions or limitations (such as blackout periods, point limitations or exclusions). Availability of any special offer is subject to change without notice. Please refer to Program Terms for more information on earning points, and redeeming points for Rewards Dollars.
You are currently eligible to redeem $6 in Rewards Dollars at checkout for every 200 Points you have accumulated. Wayfair reserves the right to increase or decrease the number of Points required to redeem Rewards Dollars. In addition, these amounts may vary by customer or by promotion. Currently, a minimum of 200 or more Points will be required to redeem for Rewards Dollars at checkout. You may redeem your points for the maximum amount of Rewards Dollars for which you are eligible that are of equal or lesser value to the total cost of product and shipping at the time of purchase. To redeem points, select “Redeem” under "Wayfair Card Rewards" at checkout. The corresponding Rewards Dollars amount will display in the Order Total. The redeemed points will be deducted from My Wayfair Card Rewards on your "Account Balance" page in "My Account". Customers can redeem points when making a purchase using any payment method, including a Wayfair Card.
Referral Program
Wayfair's Referral Program is designed to reward existing members ("Sponsors") with Rewards Dollars for referring new members ("Recipients") to Wayfair. Wayfair, AllModern, Birch Lane and Joss & Main are participating in this program and Sponsors can use their Rewards Dollars across all brands. However, Recipients can only apply their discount to the brand the Sponsor referred them to. Referral credit amounts may differ by site. Sponsors can refer as many friends as he or she would like, but will only receive Rewards Dollars for up to 10 successful referrals per month. If a Recipient's qualifying order is cancelled, Rewards Dollars will be voided. Previous purchases are not eligible for Rewards Dollars and Rewards Dollars cannot be applied retroactively. Invitations must be sent to individual recipients. Any attempt to distribute in bulk is grounds for immediate termination of the Sponsor's account and deactivation of their personal referral link. Distribution of Rewards bonuses is subject to moderation in cases of suspected fraud.
Business and Trade Referral Program
Sponsors will only receive their Rewards Dollars after their Recipient has used their unique promo code and their order has shipped. Sponsors will be notified by email when their Rewards Dollars are available for use. Rewards Dollars credited to Sponsors will only be valid for 90 days. If the Recipient does not use the unique promo code within 30 days, it will expire and no longer be valid. Previous purchases are not eligible for Rewards Dollars and Rewards Dollars cannot be applied retroactively. Orders containing Gift Certificate purchases are not eligible. Bulk distribution and distribution to strangers is prohibited. Violation of this is grounds for immediate termination of the Sponsor's account and deactivation of their personal referral link. Distribution of referral promo codes and Rewards Dollars is subject to moderation in cases of suspected fraud.
Product Reviews Program
Wayfair's Product Review Program is designed to reward existing members for writing product reviews on products purchased on Wayfair.com, AllModern.com, BirchLane.com, JossandMain.com and Perigold.com. Members may be rewarded specified Rewards Dollars or may be offered other benefits for such reviews.
Redemption of Rewards Dollars
Wayfair will post all earned Rewards Dollars on your account within a reasonable amount of time after the confirmed shipment of your qualifying purchase. Rewards Dollars can be only redeemed and applied as a credit against a purchase from one of our participating Sites. Rewards Dollars cannot be used to purchase gift cards, gift certificates, or manufacturer-excluded brands. Rewards Dollars are not redeemable for cash and cannot be returned for a cash refund, except to the extent required by law. Rewards Dollars will be automatically applied to your purchase at Checkout. If you do not wish to redeem Rewards Dollars at the time of purchase, select "Remove" at Checkout. Rewards Dollars may be combined with Wayfair promo codes, but not with any other Wayfair promotion, offer, or other discount. No credits or refunds will be issued for any reason after Rewards Dollars have been redeemed, including for unused Rewards Dollars, except as described in "Returns" below. Rewards Dollars can be used against product cost and shipping cost only. For orders with multiple items, Rewards Dollars will be applied across all items proportionally based on the dollar amount. Wayfair may apply other restrictions to or terminate the Reward Program at any time.
Returns
If you return an item that was purchased in whole or in part using Rewards Dollars, the return will be processed in accordance with Wayfair's return and exchange policy. If the return is accepted by Wayfair, the Rewards Dollars applicable to the returned item will be credited back to your account.
Rewards Dollars Balance
You can check your Rewards Dollars balance at any time by logging in at "My Account". A valid email address and password are required to view the Rewards Dollars balance in your account. Wayfair is not liable for any failure, delay or error in crediting Rewards Dollars to an account. You are responsible for all activity occurring in or through your account, including the redemption of Rewards Dollars, whether or not the activity was authorized.
Expiration
Rewards Dollars not used during the applicable Redemption Period will be forfeited. You may cancel Rewards Dollars by calling 866-263-8325 and/or sending an email to service@wayfair.com, but members recognized on any of the participating Sites are unable to opt-out of the program.
Non-Transferability and Non-Aggregation of Rewards Dollars
Rewards Dollars and any other right, obligation or benefit of the Rewards Program may not be transferred, assigned, sold, traded or bartered by any member or any other person without Wayfair's prior written consent, which Wayfair may withhold in its sole discretion, and any attempt to do any of the foregoing shall be null and void. In addition, Rewards Dollars are for the member's personal use only. Members may not aggregate Rewards Dollars from multiple accounts or use Rewards Dollars for the purpose of purchasing products from the participating Sites on behalf of others or for the purpose of reselling such products to others.
