for downloading, uploading, creating/accessing/using an account, posting, flagging, emailing, searching, or mobile use.

You agree we may moderate CL access/use in our sole discretion, e.g., by blocking, filtering, re-categorizing, re-ranking, deleting, delaying, holding, omitting, verifying, or terminating your access/license/account.
You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not.

Any tax is additional.
Fees are non-refundable, even for posts we remove, delay, omit, re-categorize, re-rank, or otherwise moderate.
