Third Party Copyrights and Other Rights
BitChute complies with copyright law and requires you to do the same.
It is BitChute's policy to suspend and/or terminate Accounts that repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights of copyright holders.
If your account is terminated in accordance with this provision then, you shall not register or attempt to register a new user account.
BitChute has the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any Content posted or uploaded by you constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy or any other law.
If you believe that a copyright you own has been infringed upon, then the following Copyright Notices process should be followed:
Copyright Notices
If you are a rights owner (or acting on behalf of a rights owner) and believe that any Content infringes your copyright, you must provide us with a written notice which states:

that you are the rights owner or are authorized to act on the rights owner's behalf;
that you have identified Content on the Site which infringes your copyright (or infringes the copyright of a third party on whose behalf you are entitled to act, if applicable) and you believe in good faith that use of the Content in the manner complained of is not authorized by you, the rights owner's agent or by law;
a description of the copyright work that you claim has been infringed which should include, the type of work (such as a photograph or a sound recording) and any relevant further details (such as the title and date of publication, as applicable);
a description of the way in which the copyright material has been infringed;
information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the Content in question on the Site (including a URL specifying the date the Site was accessed and/or a screen shot);
information that will enable us to contact you, such as your name, a postal address, telephone number and, if available, an email address (these contact details will also be provided to the alleged infringer so that they may contact you directly, in order to attempt to resolve the complaint amicably);
your electronic or physical signature (which may be a scanned copy).
and
that the information in the notice is true and accurate.

Completed notices should be sent via email to&nbsp;copyright@bitchute.com&nbsp;with a subject line beginning with 'Copyright Notice'.
This ‘notice and take down’ procedure is regulated by statute.
There may be negative consequences if you falsely allege Content is infringing copyright or send a copyright infringement notice to us in bad faith.
We suggest that you take legal advice before sending a copyright infringement notice, if you are unsure about your rights in the Content, or whether there has been an infringement of your rights.
Copyright Counter-Notices
If you believe that we have removed Content in error, you may send us a written counter-notice which states:

details of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled;
information reasonably sufficient to permit us to know where the material in question had been located on the Site (including a URL and/or screen shot);
a statement that you believe in good faith that the material that you have identified has been removed by mistake and your reasons for believing this;
information that will enable us to contact you, such as your name, a postal address, telephone number and, if available, an email address.
and
a statement that you agree to be contacted by the person (or an authorized representative of such person) who gave us the notice in the first place.

Completed counter-notices should then be sent via email to&nbsp;copyright@bitchute.com&nbsp;with a subject line beginning with 'Copyright Counter-Notice'.

Community Guidelines

Welcome to BitChute, a peer-to-peer content sharing platform and associated services.
BitChute aims to put creators first and provide them with a service that they can use to flourish and express their ideas freely.
These community guidelines give an overview of the behavior that is expected from the BitChute community, including you.
By continuing to use the site, you are agreeing with and accepting these community guidelines in their entirety.
These guidelines are provided as a set of high level Principles which outline the core expectations for all members of the community.
In addition to the Principles, the community guidelines also detail the Policies we follow when dealing with breaches of the Principles.

BITCHUTE IS ABOUT
BITCHUTE IS NOT ABOUT Freedom of Expression
Oppression or Incitement Opportunity to Succeed
Platform Bias 'People Power'
'Mob Rule' Individual Responsibility
Censorship Decentralized Distribution
Illegal Content Empowering Creators
Exploiting Creators 
Principles

These principles provide the definition of the code of conduct that we expect the community to follow.
They are intended to foster an inclusive environment where users can express themselves, their thoughts and/or opinions for open discussion, without unjust criticism or discrimination.
They are to be read and considered in their entirety.
TLDR Version
This is the Too Long Didn't Read version of the Principles.
Please note that the full version of the Principles below takes precedence.
Freedom of Expression

All creators have the same opportunity to express themselves.

Equal Rights

Everyone should be treated as equals with the same rights.
BitChute will treat all members of the community equally.
We do not grant ourselves special voting power.

Respect &amp.
Decency

Child abuse will not be tolerated.
Terrorist material will not be tolerated.
Credible threats or incitement to violence will not be tolerated.
Sexually explicit content will not be tolerated.
Malicious use of the platform will not be tolerated.

Responsibility

You are responsible for your own actions on the platform.
Creators are responsible for setting the correct sensitivity of their content.
You have a responsibility to ensure compliance with these Principles at all times.

Compliant with Law

You are expected to follow the laws of your domicile pertaining to online conduct, communication and content.
BitChute will respect applicable laws pertaining to online communications.
It is your duty to ensure that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights, referencing fair use laws appropriately.
Organizations or individuals that are engaged in terrorist activity are not permitted to use the platform.
It may be legally necessary for some content to be filtered based on the country of content consumption.


Equal Rights
All members of the community and wider society should be treated as equals with the same rights, regardless of their race, age, sex, religion, political beliefs, or any other immutable attribute or self assigned designation.
Viewers should decide through objective criteria such as views, likes and subscriptions which creators are featured most prominently across BitChute, with the expectation that the more widely accepted and supported content will rise to the top.
The site and background features are designed to help achieve this objective.
We do not grant ourselves special voting power above or beyond any other BitChute account holder, our likes and views count the same as yours.
We endeavor to apply the rules evenly and fairly, when someone breaks the rules they are subject to the same consequences as every other member of the BitChute community.
Any actions we or the community take against the members of the community need to be completely transparent, subject to appeal and it is BitChute's responsibility to make sure this is the case.
Freedom of Expression
According to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, freedom of expression is the right of every individual to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media, modern or traditional and regardless of frontiers.
The right to freedom of expression does not just apply to information and ideas generally considered to be useful or correct.
It also applies to any kind of fact or opinion that can be communicated.
The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRCm) has stressed that 'expression' is broad and not confined to political, cultural or artistic expression.
It also includes controversial, false or even shocking expression.
The mere fact that an idea is disliked or thought to be incorrect does not justify its censorship alone.
The right to freedom of expression means that states must 'respect' free expression and not interfere with it.
The right also places a positive obligation to actively ensure that obstacles to free expression are removed.
Some examples of why ensuring freedom of expression is necessary include:

Ensuring that individuals can be heard.
Holding those in a position of power to account.
Preventing the monopolization of the media by the state and/or private companies.
The development of a fair and just society.

There are numerous things on the internet that many people will find personally distasteful and they are free to avoid and/or criticize those things.
We feel strongly that every person must be allowed to share their experiences to raise awareness about issues that are important to them and potentially society as a whole.
We give all creators the same opportunity to express themselves as individuals and/or in voluntary association with others.
Respect &amp.
Decency
We expect you to show respect and decency towards fellow members of the community and others.
Child Abuse
Content threatening, inciting or promoting the abuse, sexualization, and/or exploitation of children will not be tolerated and will be reported to the appropriate authorities.
If you discover any such material on the site, we implore you to report it to us immediately using the tools provided.
Terrorist Content
Any content that is produced by and/or promoting a designated terrorist organization will not be tolerated and will be reported to the appropriate authorities.
If you discover any such material on the site, we implore you to report it to us immediately using the tools provided.
Violent Content
Any content containing credible threats and/or incitement to violence will not be tolerated, and should be reported when seen.
Content showing acts of violence should be marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) or Not Safe For Life (NSFL) using the sensitivity controls.
Sexually Explicit Content
BitChute is not intended to be a delivery platform for sexually explicit content.
Any such content should be reported when seen.
If this describes your video, even if it is a video of yourself, do not post it on BitChute.
Some content containing nudity is permitted, as long as it does not portray sexual acts and if it is marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) using the sensitivity controls.
Harmful Content
Do not post content that encourages others to do things that might cause them to get badly hurt, especially children.
Content showing harmful and/or dangerous acts should be marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) or Not Safe For Life (NSFL) using the sensitivity controls.
Malicious Use
Malicious use of the site and/or the functionality provided is not permitted.
The following are some examples of what we consider to be malicious use:


Doxing - Revealing someone's personal information without permission of the individual, including sensitive personally identifiable information such as addresses, social security numbers, passport numbers, phone numbers or bank account numbers.

Dogpiling or Brigading - Coordinated group attacks with the aim to shame, silence or otherwise shut down other users.

Unlawful Harassment - Any harassment that is determined to be unlawful within the domicile of the originator.

Spamming - Do not post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content, including comments and private messages.
Posting the same content more than once may be considered spam.

Misleading Metadata - Do not create misleading descriptions, tags, titles, or thumbnails in order to increase views or otherwise trick users.

Scamming - Do not attempt to scam others out of their earnings, views, votes or anything else.

Name Squatting - Do not name squat a user, channel or other similar entity on the site.

Metric Manipulation - Do no manipulate metrics such as views, likes and/or subscriptions.
When this is detected such metrics will be adjusted to compensate.

Any occurrences of malicious use should be reported when seen.
Responsibility
As an individual, you are responsible for your own actions, and you may be held accountable for any content that you add to the site, including but not limited to videos, titles, descriptions, comments and any other associated items.
You are not responsible for the actions of others on the site, however you should consider that others may be influenced and/or incited by the content you produce.
It is the responsibility of the content creators to ensure that the correct sensitivity is assigned to any videos that are uploaded to their channels.
All members of the community have a responsibility to each other to ensure we comply with these Principles at all times.
Compliant with Law
We expect members of the community to follow the laws of their domicile pertaining to online conduct, communication and content.
BitChute will respect applicable laws pertaining to online communications.
You own and are responsible for all of the content and information you post on BitChute.
However, before sharing content on BitChute, please be sure you have the right to do so.
We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.
You should make reference to fair use laws appropriately where applicable.
We do not allow any organizations or individuals that are engaged in terrorist activity to have a presence on BitChute.
Furthermore, material produced by and/or promoting such organizations or individuals is not permitted and will be removed.

Note: Using portions of such content can be acceptable, if it is done so appropriately for critique and/or its newsworthiness.
In some domiciles it may be legally required that those, within that domicile, who upload certain content are reported to the appropriate authorities.
For example in the case of child abuse, BitChute does comply with these laws.
When requested to do so by the authorities, we may apply filters on specific content that is considered illegal within their country.
These filters will be applied so that they do not impact viewing of the content in other countries where it is considered legal.
Policies
Verification
Registered Users of the Service can apply to have their identity verified by BitChute.
Applications are limited to Registered Users that are considered to be public figures or those that have three or more months of paid premium membership.

Note: Malicious exploitation of your verified status may lead to its removal, and your account being temporarily or permanently suspended from the Service.
Moderation
Currently moderation activities, such as reviewing reports, are carried out by BitChute staff.
So please allow a reasonable time for us to process your reports.
Notification of the result of your report will be sent to your registered email address.
In the future, we will be introducing a community based moderation process for the less controversial report classifications.
More details on this system will be published here when available.
Flagging &amp.
Reporting
If you wish to flag or report content you have seen on the website that is in violation of the community guidelines, then please use the flag functionality available on all pages that host content.
Alternatively, you can submit an email to report@bitchute.com.

Note: Abuse of the flagging and reporting processes may lead to your account being temporarily or permanently suspended from the Service..
Appeals
We are aware that sometimes the result of moderation activity may not always be satisfactory, and that new evidence may have become available to alter the outcome.
For such circumstances an appeal process has been put in place and can be requested via an email to report@bitchute.com.

Note: Abuse of the appeal process may lead to your account being temporarily or permanently suspended from the Service..
Content Sensitivity
To help users control the content that is presented to them, they can adjust the content sensitivity level via their profile preferences.
By default all content will be marked as Normal sensitivity.
Creators can mark their content as Not Safe For Work or Not Safe For Life, and are expected to do so based on the content of their videos.
The flagging, reporting, moderation and appeal processes will be employed to ensure the appropriate sensitivity level is applied to content.
Available content sensitivity levels are as follows:
Not Safe For Work (NSFW)
Content that is not safe for viewing in the workplace, or similar environments, must be marked as such by the content creator prior to publishing.
The reporting process should be utilized to flag content that has not been appropriately marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW).
Not Safe For Life (NSFL)
This level of sensitivity goes beyond Not Safe For Work (NSFW), as it does not matter where you view the material.
many if not most people will find this content upsetting.
Material that contains graphic content, which should be viewed with discretion, must be marked as Not Safe For Life (NSFL) by the content creator prior to publishing.
The reporting process should be utilized to flag content that has not been appropriately marked as Not Safe For Life (NSFL).
Normal
All content that is not assigned a specific sensitivity will be marked as Normal.
This is default for all newly created content on the site.

Note: Creators will be unable to directly change the sensitivity of content that has been set through the moderation process.

It may be legally necessary for some content to be filtered based on the country of content consumption.
 Equal Rights
All members of the community and wider society should be treated as equals with the same rights, regardless of their race, age, sex, religion, political beliefs, or any other immutable attribute or self assigned designation.
Viewers should decide through objective criteria such as views, likes and subscriptions which creators are featured most prominently across BitChute, with the expectation that the more widely accepted and supported content will rise to the top.
The site and background features are designed to help achieve this objective.
We do not grant ourselves special voting power above or beyond any other BitChute account holder, our likes and views count the same as yours.
We endeavor to apply the rules evenly and fairly, when someone breaks the rules they are subject to the same consequences as every other member of the BitChute community.
Any actions we or the community take against the members of the community need to be completely transparent, subject to appeal and it is BitChute's responsibility to make sure this is the case.
Freedom of Expression
According to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, freedom of expression is the right of every individual to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media, modern or traditional and regardless of frontiers.
The right to freedom of expression does not just apply to information and ideas generally considered to be useful or correct.
It also applies to any kind of fact or opinion that can be communicated.
The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRCm) has stressed that 'expression' is broad and not confined to political, cultural or artistic expression.
It also includes controversial, false or even shocking expression.
The mere fact that an idea is disliked or thought to be incorrect does not justify its censorship alone.
The right to freedom of expression means that states must 'respect' free expression and not interfere with it.
The right also places a positive obligation to actively ensure that obstacles to free expression are removed.
Some examples of why ensuring freedom of expression is necessary include:

Ensuring that individuals can be heard.
Holding those in a position of power to account.
Preventing the monopolization of the media by the state and/or private companies.
The development of a fair and just society.

There are numerous things on the internet that many people will find personally distasteful and they are free to avoid and/or criticize those things.
We feel strongly that every person must be allowed to share their experiences to raise awareness about issues that are important to them and potentially society as a whole.
We give all creators the same opportunity to express themselves as individuals and/or in voluntary association with others.
Respect &amp.
Decency
We expect you to show respect and decency towards fellow members of the community and others.
Child Abuse
Content threatening, inciting or promoting the abuse, sexualization, or exploitation of children will not be tolerated and will be reported to the appropriate authorities.
If you discover any such material on the site, we implore you to report it to us immediately using the tools provided.
Violent Content
Any content threatening, inciting or promoting violence will not be tolerated, and should be reported when seen.
This includes any material that is produced by and/or promoting a designated terrorist organization.
Content showing acts of violence should be marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) or Not Safe For Life (NSFL) using the sensitivity controls.
Sexually Explicit Content
BitChute is not intended to be a delivery platform for sexually explicit content.
Any such content should be reported when seen.
If this describes your video, even if it is a video of yourself, do not post it on BitChute.
Some content containing nudity is permitted, as long as it does not portray sexual acts and if it is marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) using the sensitivity controls.
Harmful Content
Do not post content that encourages others to do things that might cause them to get badly hurt, especially children.
Content showing harmful and/or dangerous acts should be marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW) or Not Safe For Life (NSFL) using the sensitivity controls.
Malicious Use
Malicious use of the site and/or the functionality provided is not permitted.
The following are some examples of what we consider to be malicious use:


Doxing - Revealing someone's personal information without permission of the individual, including sensitive personally identifiable information such as addresses, social security numbers, passport numbers, phone numbers or bank account numbers.

Dogpiling or Brigading - Coordinated group attacks with the aim to shame, silence or otherwise shut down other users.

Unlawful Harassment - Any harassment that is determined to be unlawful within the domicile of the originator.

Spamming - Do not post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content, including comments and private messages.
Posting the same content more than once may be considered spam.

Misleading Metadata - Do not create misleading descriptions, tags, titles, or thumbnails in order to increase views or otherwise trick users.

Scamming - Do not attempt to scam others out of their earnings, views, votes or anything else.

Name Squatting or Impersonation - Do not name squat or impersonate a user, channel or other similar entity on the site.

Metric Manipulation - Do no manipulate metrics such as views, likes and/or subscriptions.
When this is detected such metrics will be adjusted to compensate.

Any occurrences of malicious use should be reported when seen.
Responsibility
As an individual, you are responsible for our own actions, and you may be held accountable for any content that you add to the site, including but not limited to videos, titles, descriptions, comments and any other associated items.
You are not responsible for the actions of others on the site, however you should consider that others maybe influenced and/or incited by the content you produce.
It is the responsibility of the content creators to ensure that the correct sensitivity is assigned to any videos that are uploaded to their channels.
All members of the community have a responsibility to each other to ensure we comply with these Principles at all times.
Compliant with Law
We expect members of the community to follow the laws of their domicile pertaining to online conduct, communication and content.
BitChute will respect applicable laws pertaining to online communications.
You own and are responsible for all of the content and information you post on BitChute.
However, before sharing content on BitChute, please be sure you have the right to do so.
We ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.
You should make reference to fair use laws appropriately where applicable.
We do not allow any organizations or individuals that are engaged in terrorist activity to have a presence on BitChute.
Furthermore, material produced by and/or promoting such organizations or individuals is not permitted and will be removed.

Note: Using portions of such content can be acceptable, if it is done so appropriately for critique and/or its newsworthiness.
In some domiciles it may be legally required that those, within that domicile, who upload certain content are reported to the appropriate authorities.
For example in the case of child abuse, BitChute does comply with these laws.
When requested to do so by the authorities, we may apply filters on specific content that is considered illegal within their country.
These filters will be applied so that do not affect other countries where the content is considered legal.
Policies
Moderation
Currently moderation activities, such as reviewing reports, are carried out by BitChute staff.
So please allow a reasonable time for us to process your reports.
Notification of the result of your report will be sent to your registered email address.
In the future, we will be introducing a community based moderation process for the less controversial report classifications.
More details on this system will be published here when available.
Flagging &amp.
Reporting
If you wish to flag or report content you have seen on the website that is in violation of the community guidelines, then please use the flag functionality available on all pages that host content.
Alternatively, you can submit an email to report@bitchute.com.

Note: Abuse of the flagging and reporting processes may lead to account suspension.
Appeals
We are aware that sometimes the result of moderation activity may not always be satisfactory, and that new evidence may have become available to alter the outcome.
For such circumstances an appeal process has been put in place and can be requested via an email to report@bitchute.com.

Note: Abuse of the appeal process may lead to account suspension.
Content Sensitivity
To help users control the content that is presented to them, they can adjust the content sensitivity level via their profile preferences.
By default all content will be marked as Normal sensitivity.
Creators can mark their content as Not Safe For Work or Not Safe For Life, and are expected to do so based on the content of their videos.
The flagging, reporting, moderation and appeal processes will be employed to ensure the appropriate sensitivity level is applied to content.
Available content sensitivity levels are as follows:
Not Safe For Work (NSFW)
Content that is not safe for viewing in the workplace, or similar environments, must be marked as such by the content creator prior to publishing.
The reporting process should be utilized to flag content that has not been appropriately marked as Not Safe For Work (NSFW).
Not Safe For Life (NSFL)
This level of sensitivity goes beyond Not Safe For Work (NSFW), as it does not matter where you view the material.
many if not most people will find this content upsetting.
Material that contains graphic content, which should be viewed with discretion, must be marked as Not Safe For Life (NSFL) by the content creator prior to publishing.
The reporting process should be utilized to flag content that has not been appropriately marked as Not Safe For Life (NSFL).
Normal
All content that is not assigned a specific sensitivity will be marked as Normal.
This is default for all newly created content on the site.

Note: Creators will be unable to directly change the sensitivity of content that has been set through the moderation process.

Third Party Copyrights and Other Rights
BitChute complies with copyright law and requires you to do the same.
It is BitChute's policy to suspend and/or terminate Accounts that repeatedly infringe or are believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights of copyright holders.
If your account is terminated in accordance with this provision then, you shall not register or attempt to register a new user account.
BitChute has the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any Content posted or uploaded by you constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy or any other law.
If you believe that a copyright you own has been infringed upon, then the following Copyright Notices process should be followed:
Copyright Notices
If you are a rights owner (or acting on behalf of a rights owner) and believe that any Content infringes your copyright, you must provide us with a written notice which states:

that you are the rights owner or are authorized to act on the rights owner's behalf;
that you have identified Content on the Site which infringes your copyright (or infringes the copyright of a third party on whose behalf you are entitled to act, if applicable) and you believe in good faith that use of the Content in the manner complained of is not authorized by you, the rights owner's agent or by law;
a description of the copyright work that you claim has been infringed which should include, the type of work (such as a photograph or a sound recording) and any relevant further details (such as the title and date of publication, as applicable);
a description of the way in which the copyright material has been infringed;
information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the Content in question on the Site (including a URL specifying the date the Site was accessed and/or a screen shot);
information that will enable us to contact you, such as your name, a postal address, telephone number and, if available, an email address (these contact details will also be provided to the alleged infringer so that they may contact you directly, in order to attempt to resolve the complaint amicably);
your electronic or physical signature (which may be a scanned copy).
and
that the information in the notice is true and accurate.

Completed notices should be sent via email to legal@bitchute.com with a subject line beginning with 'Copyright Notice'.
This ‘notice and take down’ procedure is regulated by statute.
There may be negative consequences if you falsely allege Content is infringing copyright or send a copyright infringement notice to us in bad faith.
We suggest that you take legal advice before sending a copyright infringement notice, if you are unsure about your rights in the Content, or whether there has been an infringement of your rights.
Copyright Counter-Notices
If you believe that we have removed Content in error, you may send us a written counter-notice which states:

details of the Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled;
information reasonably sufficient to permit us to know where the material in question had been located on the Site (including a URL and/or screen shot);
a statement that you believe in good faith that the material that you have identified has been removed by mistake and your reasons for believing this;
information that will enable us to contact you, such as your name, a postal address, telephone number and, if available, an email address.
and
a statement that you agree to be contacted by the person (or an authorized representative of such person) who gave us the notice in the first place.

Completed counter-notices should then be sent via email to legal@bitchute.com with a subject line beginning with 'Copyright Counter-Notice'.
Termination
We may terminate your access to and use of the Service at our sole discretion, at any time and without notice to you.
You may cancel your Account at any time from within the Service.
Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the Service or your Account, the following provisions will survive: Feedback.
Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal.
Warranty Disclaimers.
Limitation of Liability.
General Terms.
Severability.
Jurisdiction and this sentence of Termination.
Warranty Disclaimers
THE SERVICE AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS.
WE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY CONTENT.
Limitation of Liability
NEITHER BITCHUTE NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICE OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT BITCHUTE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
IN NO EVENT WILL BITCHUTE'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (OR CONTENT) EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO BITCHUTE FOR USE OF THE SERVICE (OR CONTENT), OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO BITCHUTE, AS APPLICABLE.
THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN BITCHUTE AND YOU.
General Terms
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement and understanding between BitChute and you regarding the Service and Content.
These Terms supersede and replace any and all prior agreements or understanding (oral, written or otherwise) between BitChute and you regarding the Service or Content.
If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without BitChute's prior written consent.
Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and void.
BitChute may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications provided by BitChute under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by posting to the Service.
BitChute's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.
The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of BitChute.
Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
Severability
If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is deemed to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
Jurisdiction
The Terms, and your relationship with BitChute under the Terms, shall be governed by English law.
You and BitChute agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
Notwithstanding this, you agree that BitChute shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or other equivalent types of urgent legal remedy) in any jurisdiction.
